# P12196 [NOISG 2025 Prelim] Lasers 2

## 题目描述

Pavement has purchased a laser toy from Gohcart (who originally bought it from Rar the Cat). The toy features a grid of $h$ rows and $w$ columns. The rows of the grid are numbered $1$ to $h$ from top to bottom, and the columns of the grid are numbered $1$ to $w$ from left to right.

Each row contains exactly one locked sliding wall. Initially, the wall in the $i$-th row spans columns $l[i]$ to $r[i]$ ($1$-indexed), and can be unlocked for $c[i]$ dollars. Once unlocked, it can be slid horizontally to any position along the $i$-th row, as long as it is aligned to the edges of the grid. No part of the wall can leave the left or right edges of the toy.

Each column contains a downward-facing laser positioned at the top of the column. If any sliding wall is contained in the $i$-th column, it will block the path of the laser in the $i$-th column.

A possible toy with $h = 3$ and $w = 10$ is depicted in the diagram below:

Given a total budget of $k$ dollars, Pavement aims to maximise the number of lasers that are not blocked after optimally unlocking and sliding the walls. Determine the maximum number of unblocked lasers he can achieve.

## 输入格式

Your program must read from standard input.

The first line of input contains three space-separated integers $h, w$ and $k$, describing the number of rows, the number of columns and the budget, respectively.

The next $h$ lines of input each contain three space-separated integers. The $i$-th of these lines contains $l[i], r[i]$, and $c[i]$, describing the sliding wall in the $i$-th row.

## 输出格式

Your program must print to standard output.

Output a single integer, the maximum number of unblocked lasers achievable.

### Subtasks

For all testcases, the input will satisfy the following bounds:

- $1 \leq h, w \leq 2000$
- $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$
- $1 \leq l[i] \leq r[i] \leq w$ for all $1 \leq i \leq h$
- $0 \leq c[i] \leq 10^9$ for all $1 \leq i \leq h$

Your program will be tested on input instances that satisfy the following restrictions:

| Subtask | Marks | Additional constraints |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $0$ | $0$ | Sample test cases |
| $1$ | $6$ | $k = 0, c[i] = 10^9$ |
| $2$ | $9$ | $l[i] = r[i]$ |
| $3$ | $10$ | $h, w \leq 18$ |
| $4$ | $7$ | $h, w \leq 100, k \leq 2000$ |
| $5$ | $15$ | $h, w \leq 100$ |
| $6$ | $23$ | $h, w \leq 500$ |
| $7$ | $8$ | $r[1] − l[1] = r[2] − l[2] = \ldots = r[h] − l[h]$ |
| $8$ | $22$ | No additional constraints |

### Sample Test Case 1 Explanation

This test case is valid for subtasks $3, 4, 5, 6$, and $8$.

The laser toy in the above figure corresponds to this test case. Pavement can unlock the first and second sliding walls for a total cost of $9 + 1 = 10$ dollars. He can then slide the first sliding wall such that it spans columns $4$ to $7$, and slide the second sliding wall to span columns $5$ to $7$.

This leaves $6$ lasers (in columns $1, 2, 3, 8, 9$, and $10$) unblocked, which is the maximum possible.

### Sample Test Case 2 Explanation

This test case is valid for subtasks $2$ to $8$.
