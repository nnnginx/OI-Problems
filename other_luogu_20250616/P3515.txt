# P3515 [POI 2011] Lightning Conductor

## 题目描述

Progressive climate change has forced the Byteburg authorities to build a huge lightning conductor that would protect all the buildings within the city. These buildings form a row along a single street, and are numbered from 1 to $n$.

The heights of the buildings and the lightning conductor are non - negative integers. Byteburg's limited funds allow construction of only a single lightning conductor. Moreover, as you would expect, the higher it will be, the more expensive.

The lightning conductor of height $p$ located on the roof of the building $i$ (of height $h_i$) protects the building $j$ (of height $h_j$) if the following inequality holds:

$$h_j \leq h_i + p-\sqrt{|i - j|}$$

where $|i - j|$ denotes the absolute value of the difference between $i$ and $j$.

Byteasar, the mayor of Byteburg, asks your help. Write a program that, for every building $i$, determines the minimum height of a lightning conductor that would protect all the buildings if it were put on top of the building $i$.

## 输入格式

In the first line of the standard input there is a single integer $n$ ($1\leq n\leq500,000$) that denotes the number of buildings in Byteburg. Each of the following $n$ lines holds a single integer $h_i$ ($0\leq h_i\leq1,000,000$) that denotes the height of the $i$ - th building.

## 输出格式

Your program should print out exactly $n$ lines to the standard output. The $i$ - th line should give a non - negative integer $p_i$ denoting the minimum height of the lightning conductor on the $i$ - th building.
