# P12631 [NAC 2025] Solar Farm

## 题目描述

You are building a new solar farm.  The area in which you are allowed to build
is a circular field of radius $r$, and the solar panels each take up a
rectangular space of size $w \times h$.  You must place all the panels in the same
orientation of your choice in a single rectangular array (so that all of the panels combined
exactly form a single rectangle).  What is the maximum number of panels that you can fit in this farm?

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ ($1\leq T \leq 1\,000$).
This is the number of test cases.

The next $T$ lines of input each represent one test case and consist of three space-separated integers $r$, $w$, and $h$
($1 \leq r, w, h \leq 10^9$): the radius of the field, the width of
each solar panel, and the height of each solar panel, respectively.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print a line with a single integer: the maximum
number of solar panels that can be placed in a solar farm within the circular
field.
