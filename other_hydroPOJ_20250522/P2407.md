<h2>Description</h2><p>Given n, a positive integer, how many positive integers less than n are relatively prime to n? Two integers a and b are relatively prime if there are no integers x &gt; 1, y &gt; 0, z &gt; 0 such that a = xy and b = xz. </p><h2>Input</h2><p>There are several test cases. For each test case, standard input contains a line with n &lt;= 1,000,000,000. A line containing 0 follows the last case. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case there should be single line of output answering the question posed above.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">7
