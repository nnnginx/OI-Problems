<h2>Description</h2><p>The art galleries of the new and very futuristic building of the Center for Balkan Cooperation have the form of polygons (not necessarily convex). When a big exhibition is organized, watching over all of the pictures is a big security concern. Your task is that for a given gallery to write a program which finds the surface of the area of the floor, from which each point on the walls of the gallery is visible. On the figure 1. a map of a gallery is given in some co-ordinate system. The area wanted is shaded on the figure 2.

Input data for each task start with an integer N, 5 &lt;= N &lt;= 1500. Each of the next N rows of the input will contain the co-ordinates of a vertex of the polygon ? two integers that fit in 16-bit integer type, separated by a single space. Following the row with the co-ordinates of the last vertex for the task comes the line with the number of vertices for the next test and so on. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test you must write on one line the required surface - a number with exactly two digits after the decimal point (the number should be rounded to the second digit after the decimal point).</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
