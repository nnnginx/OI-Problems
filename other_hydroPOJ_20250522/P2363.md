<h2>Description</h2><p>Donald wishes to send a gift to his new nephew, Fooey. Donald is a bit of a traditionalist, so he has chosen to send a set of N classic baby blocks. Each block is a cube, 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch. Donald wants to stack the blocks together into a rectangular solid and wrap them all up in brown paper for shipping. How much brown paper does Donald need? </p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains C, the number of test cases. For each case there is an additional line containing N, the number of blocks to be shipped. N does not exceed 1000.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Your program should produce one line of output per case, giving the minimal area of paper (in square inches) needed to wrap the blocks when they are stacked together.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
