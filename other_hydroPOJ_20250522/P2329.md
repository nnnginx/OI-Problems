<h2>Description</h2><p>Input is the matrix A of N by N non-negative integers.
</p>
A distance between two elements A<sub>ij</sub><p> and A</p><sub>pq</sub><p> is defined as |i − p| + |j − q|.
</p>
Your program must replace each zero element in the matrix with the nearest non-zero one. If there are two or more nearest non-zeroes, the zero must be left in place.
