The relation "romantically involved" is defined between one girl and one boy. For the study reasons it is necessary to find out the maximum set satisfying the condition: there are no two students in the set who have been "romantically involved". The result of the program is the number of students in such a set.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains several data sets in text format. Each data set represents one set of subjects of the study, with the following description:
