<h2>Description</h2><p>Hassan, helping with his younger brother's homework, found out that when you multiply 102564 by 4, its right-most digit moves to the left, and the other digits move one position to the right; i.e. 4 * 102564 = 410256. We call a number that has this property when multiplied by n, an n-dramatic number. For instance, 102564 and 128205 are both 4-dramatic. Given two one-digit numbers n and k, the goal is to find the smallest n-dramatic number that its rightmost digit is k.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>On the first line of the input, there is an integer t, which is the number of cases that follow. Each test case, is on a line by itself, and contains two integers n and k, where 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 9, and 1 &lt;= k &lt;= 9.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output a single integer on a line by itself, which is the smallest n-dramatic number that its rightmost digit is k. If no such number exists, output 0 instead.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">2
