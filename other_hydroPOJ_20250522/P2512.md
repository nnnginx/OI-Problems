<h2>Description</h2><p>In the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation), a chessboard is described as follows: 
</p><ul><li>The Board-Content is specified starting with the top row and ending with the bottom row. 
<br></li><li>Character / is used to separate data of adjacent rows. 
<br></li><li>Each row is specified from left to right. 
<br></li><li>White pieces are identified by uppercase piece letters: PNBRQK. 
<br></li><li>Black pieces are identified by lowercase piece letters: pnbrqk. 
<br></li><li>Empty squares are represented by the numbers one through eight. 
<br></li><li>A number used represents the count of contiguous empty squares along a row. 
<br></li><li>Each row's sum of numbers and characters must equal 8. </li></ul><p>
</p>For example: 
<ul>5k1r/2q3p1/p3p2p/1B3p1Q/n4P2/6P1/bbP2N1P/1K1RR3</ul><p>
</p>is the FEN notation description of the following chessboard:

</p>The chessboard of the beginning of a chess game is described in FEN as: 
<ul>rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR</ul><p>
</p>Your task is simple: given a chessboard description in a FEN notation you are asked to compute the number of unoccupied squares on the board which are not attacked by any piece.<h2>Input</h2><p>Input is a sequence of lines, each line containing a FEN description of a chessboard. Note that the description does not necessarily give a legal chess position. Input lines do not contain whitespace.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each line of input, output one line containing an integer which gives the number of unoccupied squares which are not attacked.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5k1r/2q3p1/p3p2p/1B3p1Q/n4P2/6P1/bbP2N1P/1K1RR3
