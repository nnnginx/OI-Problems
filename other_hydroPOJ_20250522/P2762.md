<h2>Description</h2><p>In order to make their sons brave, Jiajia and Wind take them to a big cave. The cave has n rooms, and one-way corridors connecting some rooms. Each time, Wind choose two rooms x and y, and ask one of their little sons go from one to the other. The son can either go from x to y, or from y to x. Wind promised that her tasks are all possible, but she actually doesn't know how to decide if a task is possible. To make her life easier, Jiajia decided to choose a cave in which every pair of rooms is a possible task. Given a cave, can you tell Jiajia whether Wind can randomly choose two rooms without worrying about anything?</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. And followed T cases.
</p>
The first line for each case contains two integers n, m(0 &lt; n &lt; 1001,m &lt; 6000), the number of rooms and corridors in the cave. The next m lines each contains two integers u and v, indicating that there is a corridor connecting room u and room v directly.
<h2>Output</h2><p>The output should contain T lines. Write 'Yes' if the cave has the property stated above, or 'No' otherwise.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
