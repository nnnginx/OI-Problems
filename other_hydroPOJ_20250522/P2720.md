<h2>Description</h2><p>Exponentiation of one integer by another often produces very large results. In this problem, we will compute a function based on repeated exponentiation, but output only the last n digits of the result. Doing this efficiently requires careful thought about how to avoid computing the full answer. 
</p>
Given integers b, n, and i, we define the function f(x) recursively by f(x) = b<sup>f(x-1)</sup><p> if x &gt; 0, and f(0)=1. Your job is to efficiently compute the last n decimal digits of f(i). 
</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of a number of test cases. Each test case starts with the integer b (1 &lt;= b &lt;= 100) called the base. On the next line is the integer i (1 &lt;= i &lt;= 100) called the iteration count. And finally, the last line contains the number n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 7), which is the number of decimal digits to output. The input is terminated when b = 0. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print on one line the last n digits of f(i) for the base b specified. If the result has fewer than n digits, pad the result with zeroes on the left so that there are exactly n digits. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">2
