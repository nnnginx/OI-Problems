<h2>Description</h2><p>The SUM problem can be formulated as follows: given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many quadruplet (a, b, c, d ) ¡Ê A x B x C x D are such that a + b + c + d = 0 . In the following, we assume that all lists have the same size n . </p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input file contains the size of the lists n (this value can be as large as 4000). We then have n lines containing four integer values (with absolute value as large as 2</p><sup>28</sup><p> ) that belong respectively to A, B, C and D . </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each input file, your program has to write the number quadruplets whose sum is zero. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">6
