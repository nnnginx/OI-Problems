<h2>Description</h2><p>In this problem you will be given a series of lists containing both words and numbers. The goal is to sort these lists in such a way that all words are in alphabetical order and all numbers are in numerical order. Furthermore, if the nth element in the list is a number it must remain a number, and if it is a word it must remain a word. </p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input will contain multiple lists, one per line. Each element of the list will be separated by a comma followed a space, and the list will be terminated by a period. The input will be terminated by a line containing only a single period. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each list in the input, output the scramble sorted list, separating each element of the list with a comma followed by a space, and ending the list with a period. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">0.
