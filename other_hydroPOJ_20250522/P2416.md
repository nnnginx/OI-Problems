<h2>Description</h2><p>Luke Skywalker races through the forest on a speeder bike, trying to outrun a patrol of Imperial scouts on Endor. A small moon near a new Death Star, Endor is covered by dense foliage and a thick forest of ancient towering trees. The speeder bike , which Luke stole from an Imperial scout, is an antigravity vehicle capable of speeds of 200 miles an hour. How quickly can Luke reach Princess Leia in the Ewok village? 
</p>The forest is a plane with T trees. Luke's position is specified by a pair of coordinates ( x<sub>luke</sub><p> , y</p><sub>luke</sub><p> ) within the plane. The Ewok village has coordinates ( x</p><sub>ewok</sub><p> , y</p><sub>ewok</sub><p> ). You are to find the shortest travel time from Luke's position to the Ewok village. 
</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains T, x</p><sub>luke</sub><p> , y</p><sub>luke</sub><p> x</p><sub>ewok</sub><p> , y</p><sub>ewok</sub><p> . T lines follow; each gives the coordinates and diameter of a tree: x</p><sub>tree<sub>i</sub></sub><p> , y</p><sub>tree<sub>i</sub></sub><p> , d</p><sub>tree<sub>i</sub></sub><p> . T is an integer not exceeding 10; coordinates and diameters are real numbers in miles. Trees do not intersect or touch one another. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>Output is a single real number, to two decimal places, giving the minimum travel time in seconds.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">2 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.0
