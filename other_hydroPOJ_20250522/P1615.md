<h2>Description</h2><p>Let S be a sequence of n integers, where S[k] with 1 &lt;= k &lt;= n denotes the k-th number of S. The maximum prefix sum of S, denoted h(S), is defined to be
</p><div align="center">h(S) = max<sub>0&lt;=j&lt;=n</sub>∑<sub>1&lt;=k&lt;=j</sub>S[k].</div><p>
</p>(Note that the range for j starting from 0 is to ensure h(S) &gt;= 0, because ∑<sub>1&lt;=k&lt;=0</sub><p>S[k]=0.) For example, if
</p>W = −2, 1,−3;
X = 1, 2, 4, 3,−1,−5, 2, 0,−1, 3,−2;
Y = −1, 2, 0, 1, 3,−5, 3, 2, 4,−2,−1,
then h(W) = 0, h(X) = 1+2+4+3 = 10 and h(Y) = −1+2+0+1+3−5+3+2+4 = 9.
For each i = 1, 2, . . . , l, let Si be a sequence of ni integers. We say that a sequence S of n numbers is a merged sequence of S1, S2, . . . , Sl if the following conditions hold.
1. n = n1 + n2 + ... + nl.
2. There is a 1-1 mapping f from {1, 2, . . . , n} to {(i, j) | 1 &lt;= i &lt;= l and 1 &lt;= j &lt;= ni} such that if f(t) = (i, j) then S[t] = Si[j].
3. If t &lt; t', f(t) = (i, j) and f(t') = (i, j'), then j &lt; j'.
For example, if we have
S1 = 1, 3,−5, 2,−2;
S2 = 2, 4,−1;
S3 = −1, 0, 3,
then both X and Y above are merged sequences of S1, S2, S3. The following sequence,however, is not a merged sequence of S1, S2, S3.
Z = 1, 3,−5, 2,−2, 2, 4,−1,−1, 3, 0.
(Clearly, if the last two numbers 3 and 0 in Z are exchanged, then the resulting sequence is a merged sequence of S1, S2, S3.)
Your job is to produce a merged sequence S of S1, S2, . . . , Sl with minimum h(S*).
For instance, the following sequence is a merged sequence for the above S1, S2, S3 whose maximum prefix sum is minimized:
S* = −1, 1, 0, 3,−5, 2,−2, 2, 4,−1, 3.
One can verify that h(S) = −1 + 1 + 0 + 3 − 5 + 2 − 2 + 2 + 4 − 1 + 3 = 6.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line contains a number m with 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 10 indicating the number of test cases. Each of the next m lines lists a test case. Each test case lists those l (1 &lt;= l &lt;= 5) input sequences separated by numbers 9999. Each test case ends with a number −9999. Two consecutive numbers in a sequence are separated by at least one single space. You may assume that each input sequence consists of at most 100 integers, each of which is between −100 and 100.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case S1, S2, . . . , Sl, output its h(S*) in a single line.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
