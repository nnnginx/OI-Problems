<h2>Description</h2><p>The twenty-first century is a biology-technology developing century. One of the most attractive and challenging tasks is on the gene project, especially on gene sorting program. Recently we know that a gene is made of DNA. The nucleotide bases from which DNA is built are A(adenine), C(cytosine), G(guanine), and T(thymine). Given several segments of a gene, you are asked to make a shortest sequence from them. The sequence should use all the segments, and you cannot flip any of the segments.
</p>
For example, given 'TCGG', 'GCAG', 'CCGC', 'GATC' and 'ATCG', you can slide the segments in the following way and get a sequence of length 11. It is the shortest sequence (but may be not the only one).

</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line is an integer T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 20), which shows the number of the cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of every test case contains an integer N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10), which represents the number of segments. The following N lines express N segments, respectively. Assuming that the length of any segment is between 1 and 20.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print a line containing the length of the shortest sequence that can be made from these segments.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
