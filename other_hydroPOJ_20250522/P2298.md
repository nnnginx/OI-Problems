<h2>Description</h2><p>Airplanes fly close to the Great Circle Route between two cities. The Great Circle Route is the shortest arc concentric with the earth that joins the two cities; that is, the shortest distance between the two cities following the surface of the earth. 
</p>Given the latitude and longitude of two cities, find the most northerly latitude reached on the Great Circle Route between the cities. Print "undefined" if there is no unique answer. <h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains N, the number of test cases. N lines follow, one for each case, containing the latitude and longitude of the two cities, in degrees, minutes, and direction. [A minute is 1/60 degree; Points on the equator have latitude denoted 0,0N (not 0,0S); points on the poles have longitude denoted 0,0W; points with 180 degrees longitude are denoted 180,0W (not 180,0E).] </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each case your program should produce one line of output giving the most northerly latitude reached, in the given format. Round your answer to the nearest minute. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
