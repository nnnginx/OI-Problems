<h2>Description</h2><p>Given any string of decimal digits, ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9, there is always a decimal number, which when cubed has a decimal expansion ending in the original given digit string. The number need never have more digits than the given digit string.</p><p>Write a program, which takes as input a string of decimal digits ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9 and finds a number of at most the same number of digits, which when cubed, ends in the given digit string.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input begins with a line containing only the count of problem instances, <i>nProb</i>, as a decimal integer, 1 <span lang="en-us">¡Ü <i>nProb</i> ¡Ü</span> 1000. This is followed by <i>nProb</i> lines, each of which contains a string of between 1 and 10 decimal digits ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each problem instance, there should be one line of output consisting of the number, which when cubed, ends in the given digit string. The number should be output as a decimal integer with no leading spaces and no leading zeroes.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
