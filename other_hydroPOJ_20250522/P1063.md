<h2>Description</h2><p>This puzzle consists of a random sequence of m black disks and n white disks on an oval-shaped track, with a turnstile capable of flipping (i.e., reversing) three consecutive disks. In Figure 1, there are 8 black disks and 10 white disks on the track. You may spin the turnstile to flip the three disks in it or shift one position clockwise for each of  the disks on the track (Figure 1).

</p>The goal of  this puzzle  is  to gather  the disks of  the  same color  in adjacent positions using  flips and  shifts. (Figure 2)

</p>You  are  to write  a  program which  decides whether  a  given  sequence  can  reach  a  goal  or  not.  If  a  goal  is reachable, then write a message "YES"; otherwise, write a message "NO". <h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of T  test cases. The number of test cases  ) (T  is given in the first line of the input file. Each of the next T  lines gives a test case. A test case consists of an integer, representing the sum of m and n, and a sequence of m+n  0s and 1s, representing an initial sequence. A 0 denotes a white disk and a 1 denotes a black disk. The sum of m and n is at least 10 and does not exceed  30. There is a space between numbers. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output should print  either "YES" or "NO" for each test case, one per line.  </p><pre><code class="language-input1">2
