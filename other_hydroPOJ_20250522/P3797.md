<h2>Description</h2><p>We wish to tile a grid 4 units high and N units long with rectangles (dominoes) 2 units by one unit (in either orientation).  For example, the figure shows the five different ways that a grid 4 units high and 2 units wide may be tiled.

</p>
Write a program that takes as input the width, W, of the grid and outputs the number of different ways to tile a 4-by-W grid.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 1000) which is the number of datasets that follow. 
</p> 
Each dataset contains a single decimal integer, the width, W, of the grid for this problem instance.<h2>Output</h2><p>For each problem instance, there is one line of output:  The problem instance number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a single space and the number of tilings of a 4-by-W grid.  The values of W will be chosen so the count will fit in a 32-bit integer.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
