<h2>Description</h2><p>A friend of you has just bought a new computer. Until now, the most powerful computer he ever used has been a pocket calculator. Now, looking at his new computer, he is a bit disappointed, because he liked the LC-display of his calculator so much. So you decide to write a program that displays numbers in an LC-display-like style on his computer. </p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains several lines, one for each number to be displayed. Each line contains two integers s, n (1 &lt;= s &lt;= 10, 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 99 999 999), where n is the number to be displayed and s is the size in which it shall be displayed. 
</p>
The input file will be terminated by a line containing two zeros. This line should not be processed. <h2>Output</h2><p>Output the numbers given in the input file in an LC-display-style using s "-" signs for the horizontal segments and s "|" signs for the vertical ones. Each digit occupies exactly s+2 columns and 2s+3 rows. (Be sure to fill all the white space occupied by the digits with blanks, also for the last digit.) There has to be exactly one column of blanks between two digits. 
</p>
Output a blank line after each number. (You will find a sample of each digit in the sample output.) <pre><code class="language-input1">2 12345
