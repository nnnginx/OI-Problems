<h2>Description</h2><p>A traditional game is played between two players on a pool of n numbers (not necessarily distinguishing ones).
</p>
The first player will choose from the pool a number x1 lying in [a, b] (0 &lt; a &lt; b), which means a &lt;= x1 &lt;= b. Next the second player should choose a number y1 such that y1 - x1 lies in [a, b] (Attention! This implies y1 &gt; x1 since a &gt; 0). Then the first player should choose a number x2 such that x2 - y1 lies in [a, b]... The game ends when one of them cannot make a choice. Note that a player MUST NOT skip his turn.

A player's score is determined by the numbers he has chose, by the way: 

player1score = x1 + x2 + ...
player2score = y1 + y2 + ...

If you are player1, what is the maximum score difference (player1score - player2score) you can get? It is assumed that player2 plays perfectly.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line contains a single integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 20) indicating the number of test cases. Then follow the t cases. Each case contains exactly two lines. The first line contains three integers, n, a, b (2 &lt;= n &lt;= 10000, 0 &lt; a &lt; b &lt;= 100); the second line contains n integers, the numbers in the pool, any of which lies in [-9999, 9999].</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each case, print the maximum score difference player1 can get. Note that it can be a negative, which means player1 cannot win if player2 plays perfectly.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
