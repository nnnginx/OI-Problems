<h2>Description</h2><p>There are <b>K</b> line segments on a plane. These are all segments of a broken line, in arbitrary order. Write a program to check whether the broken line is closed.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>Input data is in (4*<b>K</b>+1) lines, each of them consists of no more then 250 characters. The first line of the file contains the number of segments <b>K</b> (1¡Ü<b>K</b>¡Ü3000). Each segment is described by the coordinates <b>X¡¯</b>, <b>Y¡¯</b>, <b>X¡¯¡¯</b>, and <b>Y¡¯¡¯</b> of its end-points. All coordinates are non-negatives integers and written in separate lines (so, the coordinates of one segment are in four sequential lines).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>The first and only line of the file must contain the number 1 if the broken line is closed, and 0 otherwise.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
