<h2>Description</h2><p>a program that, given a natural number N between 0 and 4999 (inclusively), and M distinct decimal digits X1,X2..XM (at least one), finds the smallest strictly positive multiple of N that has no other digits besides X1,X2..XM (if such a multiple exists).</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input has several data sets separated by an empty line, each data set having the following format:
</p>
On the first line - the number N
On the second line - the number M
On the following M lines - the digits X1,X2..XM.<h2>Output</h2><p>For each data set, the program should write to standard output on a single line the multiple, if such a multiple exists, and 0 otherwise.
