<h2>Description</h2><p>Let us define a regular brackets sequence in the following way:
</p>
1. Empty sequence is a regular sequence.
2. If S is a regular sequence, then (S) and [S] are both regular sequences.
3. If A and B are regular sequences, then AB is a regular sequence.

For example, all of the following sequences of characters are regular brackets sequences:

(), [], (()), ([]), ()[], ()[()]

And all of the following character sequences are not:

(, [, ), )(, ([)], ([(]

Some sequence of characters '(', ')', '[', and ']' is given. You are to find the shortest possible regular brackets sequence, that contains the given character sequence as a subsequence. Here, a string a1 a2 ... an is called a subsequence of the string b1 b2 ... bm, if there exist such indices 1 = i1 &lt; i2 &lt; ... &lt; in = m, that aj = bij for all 1 = j = n.<h2>Input</h2><p>The input file contains at most 100 brackets (characters '(', ')', '[' and ']') that are situated on a single line without any other characters among them.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Write to the output file a single line that contains some regular brackets sequence that has the minimal possible length and contains the given sequence as a subsequence.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">([(]</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">()[()]</code></pre><h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=Northeastern+Europe+2001">Northeastern Europe 2001</a>
