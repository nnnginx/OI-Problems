<h2>Description</h2><p>The FORTH programming language does not support floating-point arithmetic at all. Its author, Chuck Moore, maintains that floating-point calculations are too slow and most of the time can be emulated by integers with proper scaling. For example, to calculate the area of the circle with the radius R he suggests to use formula like R * R * 355 / 113, which is in fact surprisingly accurate. The value of 355 / 113 ¡Ö 3.141593 is approximating the value of PI with the absolute error of only about 2*10</p><sup>-7</sup><p>. You are to find the best integer approximation of a given floating-point number A within a given integer limit L. That is, to find such two integers N and D (1 &lt;= N, D &lt;= L) that the value of absolute error |A - N / D| is minimal.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains a floating-point number A (0.1 &lt;= A &lt; 10) with the precision of up to 15 decimal digits. The second line contains the integer limit L. (1 &lt;= L &lt;= 100000).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Output file must contain two integers, N and D, separated by space.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3.14159265358979
