<h2>Description</h2><p>It is well known that¦Ð¡Ö22/7.You can verify that for all integers p and q satisfying 1&lt;=q&lt;=7 and p/q ¡Ù 22/7, we have |22 - 7¦Ð| &lt; |p - q¦Ð|. Furthermore, 355/133 is another good approximation of ¦Ð.You can also verify that for all integers p and q satisfying 1&lt;=q&lt;=113 and p/q ¡Ù 355/113, we have |355 - 113¦Ð| &lt; |p - q¦Ð|.

Let p, q, x, y, x1 and y1 be integers, ¦Á be a real number and q &gt; 0. We say that y/x is d-closer to ¦Áthan y1/x1 if  |y - x¦Á| &lt; |y1 - x1¦Á|. Notice that if ¦Á is also a rational number p/q, then the inequality |yq - xp| &lt; |y1q - x1p| is equivalent to |y - x¦Á| &lt; |y1 - x1¦Á| . This can be used to avoid oating point operations. If y/x is d-closer to ¦Áthan any other rational number y1/x1 with denominator x1 in the range from 1 to x, then y/x is called a good approximation of ¦Á. Let G(¦Á) be the set of all good approximations ¦Á and |G(¦Á) | be the cardinality of G(¦Á). The cardinality of a set G(¦Á) is the number of elements in G(¦Á). We use an example to illustrate these symbols. Let ¦Á=37/13. The good approximations of ¦Á are 3/1,17/6 and 37/13. The rational number 3/1 is a good approximation of ¦Á since no other rational number with denominator 1 and an integer numerator is d-closer to ¦Á than 17/6. A similar reason holds for 37/13. It is clear that no rational number with denominator greater than 6 and an integer numerator is d-closer to ¦Á than 37/13 since |37 - 13¦Á| =0. Therefore, G(¦Á)={3/1, 17/6, 37/13} and  |G(¦Á) |=3. Similarly, you can fi nd that G(237/113)={2/1, 21/10, 65/31, 86/41, 237/113} and  |G(237/113) |=5.

Given a rational number ¦Á, you are asked to design a program for finding |G(¦Á) |.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input file contains an integer n, n&lt;=10, which represents the number of test cases. Then, the cases are listed line by line. In each line, there are two integers pk and qk separated by a space which are the numerator and denominator, respectively, of test case k, k = 1, 2,...,n. Note that 1 &lt;= pk, qk &lt;= 10000.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>List the value of |G(pk/qk) | in line k for k = 1, 2,...,n.
