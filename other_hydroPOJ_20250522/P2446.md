<h2>Description</h2><p>Alice and Bob often play games on chessboard. One day, Alice draws a board with size M * N. She wants Bob to use a lot of cards with size 1 * 2 to cover the board. However, she thinks it too easy to bob, so she makes some holes on the board (as shown in the figure below). 
</p><center><img src="images/2446_1.jpg"></center><p>
</p>We call a grid, which doesn¡¯t contain a hole, a normal grid. Bob has to follow the rules below:
1. Any normal grid should be covered with exactly one card.
2. One card should cover exactly 2 normal adjacent grids.

Some examples are given in the figures below:

<br>A VALID solution.</center><p>
</p><center><img src="images/2446_3.jpg">
<br>An invalid solution, because the hole of red color is covered with a card.</center><p>
</p><center><img src="images/2446_4.jpg">
<br>An invalid solution, because there exists a grid, which is not covered.</center><p>
</p>Your task is to help Bob to decide whether or not the chessboard can be covered according to the rules above.<h2>Input</h2><p>There are 3 integers in the first line: m, n, k (0 &lt; m, n &lt;= 32, 0 &lt;= K &lt; m * n), the number of rows, column and holes. In the next k lines, there is a pair of integers (x, y) in each line, which represents a hole in the y-th row, the x-th column.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>If the board can be covered, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4 3 2
