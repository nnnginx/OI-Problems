<h2>Description</h2><p>We can number binary trees using the following scheme: 
</p>The empty tree is numbered 0.
The single-node tree is numbered 1.
All binary trees having m nodes have numbers less than all those having m+1 nodes.
Any binary tree having m nodes with left and right subtrees L and R is numbered n such that all trees having m nodes numbered &gt; n have either Left subtrees numbered higher than L, or A left subtree = L and a right subtree numbered higher than R.

The first 10 binary trees and tree number 20 in this sequence are shown below:

</p>Your job for this problem is to output a binary tree when given its order number.
<h2>Input</h2><p>Input consists of multiple problem instances. Each instance consists of a single integer n, where 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 500,000,000. A value of n = 0 terminates input. (Note that this means you will never have to output the empty tree.)</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each problem instance, you should output one line containing the tree corresponding to the order number for that instance. To print out the tree, use the following scheme:
</p>
A tree with no children should be output as X.
A tree with left and right subtrees L and R should be output as (L')X(R'), where L' and R' are the representations of L and R.
  If L is empty, just output X(R').
  If R is empty, just output (L')X.
