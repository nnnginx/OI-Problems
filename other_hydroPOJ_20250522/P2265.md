<h2>Description</h2><p>Maja is a bee. She lives in a bee hive with thousands of other bees. This bee hive consists of many hexagonal honey combs where the honey is stored in. 
</p>But bee Maja has a problem. Willi told her where she can meet him, but because Willi is a male drone and Maja is a female worker they have different coordinate systems. 
<center><table><tbody><tr><th><center>Maja's Coordinate System</center></th><th>      <center>Willi's Coordinate System</center></th></tr><tr><td>Maja who often flies directly to a special honey comb has laid an advanced two dimensional grid over the whole hive.</td><td>Willi who is more lazy and often walks around just numbered the cells clockwise starting from 1 in the middle of the hive. </td></tr><tr><td><img alt="Maja" src="images/2265_1.jpg"></td><td><img alt="Willi" src="images/2265_2.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
</p>Help Maja to convert Willi's system to hers. Write a program which for a given honey comb number gives the coordinates in Maja's system. <h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains one or more integers which represent Willi's numbers. Each number stands on its own in a separate line, directly followed by a newline. The honey comb numbers are all less than 100 000. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>You should output the corresponding Maja coordinates to Willi's numbers, each coordinate pair on a separate line. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
