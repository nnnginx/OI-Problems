</p>Figure 1 shows the map of a castle.Write a program that calculates
1. how many rooms the castle has
2. how big the largest room is
The castle is divided into m * n (m&lt;=50, n&lt;=50) square modules. Each such module can have between zero and four walls. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>Your program is to read from standard input. The first line contains the number of modules in the north-south direction and the number of modules in the east-west direction. In the following lines each module is described by a number (0 &lt;= p &lt;= 15). This number is the sum of: 1 (= wall to the west), 2 (= wall to the north), 4 (= wall to the east), 8 (= wall to the south). Inner walls are defined twice; a wall to the south in module 1,1 is also indicated as a wall to the north in module 2,1. The castle always has at least two rooms.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Your program is to write to standard output: First the number of rooms, then the area of the largest room (counted in modules).</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
