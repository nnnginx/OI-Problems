<h2>Description</h2><img src="images/2526_1.jpg" align="right"><p>Given is a set of n points with integer coordinates. Your task is to decide whether the set has a center of symmetry. 
</p>
A set of points S has the center of symmetry if there exists a point s (not necessarily in S) such that for every point p in S there exists a point q in S such that p-s = s-q.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains a number c giving the number of cases that follow. The first line of data for a single case contains number 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10000. The subsequent n lines contain two integer numbers each which are the x and y coordinates of a point. Every point is unique and we have that -10000000 &lt;= x, y &lt;= 10000000. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each set of input data print yes if the set of points has a center of symmetry and no otherwise.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
