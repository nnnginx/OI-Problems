<h2>Description</h2><p>A pretty straight forward task, calculate the number of primes between 2 integers.
</p>
Given 2 integers A ¡Ü B &lt; 10<sup>5</sup><p> what¡¯s the number of primes in range from A to B inclusive.
</p>
Note: A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 and is divisible by 1 and itself only. For N to be prime it is enough to test the divisibility of numbers less than or equal to square root of N.<h2>Input</h2><p>As many as 1000 lines, each line contains 2 integers A and B separated by a space. Input is terminated when A = B = -1 (Do not process this line).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For every line in input ¨C except for the last line where A = B = -1 - print the number of prime numbers between A and B inclusive.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">0 9999
