<h2>Description</h2><p>A single-player game is played on a rectangular board divided in R rows and C columns. There is a single uppercase letter (A-Z) written in every position in the board.
</p>Before the begging of the game there is a figure in the upper-left corner of the board (first row, first column). In every move, a player can move the figure to the one of the adjacent positions (up, down,left or right). Only constraint is that a figure cannot visit a position marked with the same letter twice.
The goal of the game is to play as many moves as possible.
Write a program that will calculate the maximal number of positions in the board the figure can visit in a single game.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains two integers R and C, separated by a single blank character, 1 &lt;= R, S &lt;= 20.
</p>The following R lines contain S characters each. Each line represents one row in the board.<h2>Output</h2><p>The first and only line of the output should contain the maximal number of position in the board the figure can visit.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3 6
