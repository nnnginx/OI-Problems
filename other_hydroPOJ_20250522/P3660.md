<h2>Description</h2><div><p><i>N</i> (1 ¡Ü <i>N</i> ¡Ü 100) cows, conveniently numbered 1..<i>N</i>, are participating in a programming contest. As we all know, some cows code better than others. Each cow has a certain constant skill rating that is unique among the competitors.</p><p>The contest is conducted in several head-to-head rounds, each between two cows. If cow <i>A</i> has a greater skill level than cow <i>B</i> (1 ¡Ü <i>A</i> ¡Ü <i>N</i>; 1 ¡Ü <i>B</i> ¡Ü <i>N</i>; <i>A</i> ¡Ù <i>B</i>), then cow <i>A</i> will always beat cow <i>B</i>.</p><p>Farmer John is trying to rank the cows by skill level. Given a list the results of <i>M</i> (1 ¡Ü <i>M</i> ¡Ü 4,500) two-cow rounds, determine the number of cows whose ranks can be precisely determined from the results. It is guaranteed that the results of the rounds will not be contradictory.</p></div><h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: <i>N</i> and <i>M</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>M</i>+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers that describe the competitors and results (the first integer, <i>A</i>, is the winner) of a single round of competition: <i>A</i> and <i>B</i></p><h2>Output</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer representing the number of cows whose ranks can be determined<br>¡¡</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5 5
