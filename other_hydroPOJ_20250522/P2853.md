<h2>Description</h2><p>Most positive integers may be written as a sum of a sequence of at least two consecutive positive integers. For instance,</p><pre>6 = 1 + 2 + 3<br>9 = 5 + 4 = 2 + 3 + 4</pre><p>but </p><tt>8</tt><p> cannot be so written.</p><p>Write a program which will compute how many different ways an input number may be written as a sum of a sequence of at least two consecutive positive integers.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input will contain the number of problem instances <i>N</i> on a line by itself, (1 <span lang="en-us">¡Ü <i>N</i> ¡Ü</span> 1000) . This will be followed by <i>N</i> lines, one for each problem instance. Each problem line will have the problem number, a single space and the number to be written as a sequence of consecutive positive integers. The second number will be less than 2<sup>31</sup> (so will fit in a 32-bit integer).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output for each problem instance will be a single line containing the problem number, a single space and the number of ways the input number can be written as a sequence of consecutive positive integers.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">7
