<h2>Description</h2><p>In how many ways can you choose k elements out of n elements, not taking order into account? 
</p>Write a program to compute this number. <h2>Input</h2><p>The input will contain one or more test cases. 
</p>Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n (n&gt;=1) and k (0&lt;=k&lt;=n). 
Input is terminated by two zeroes for n and k. <h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print one line containing the required number. This number will always fit into an integer, i.e. it will be less than 2</p><sup>31</sup><p>. 
</p>Warning: Don't underestimate the problem. The result will fit into an integer - but if all intermediate results arising during the computation will also fit into an integer depends on your algorithm. The test cases will go to the limit.
