<h2>Description</h2><p>A catenym is a pair of words separated by a period such that the last letter of the first word is the same as the last letter of the second. For example, the following are catenyms: 
</p><pre>dog.gopher
<br>gopher.rat
<br>rat.tiger
<br>aloha.aloha
<br>arachnid.dog</pre><p>
</p>A compound catenym is a sequence of three or more words separated by periods such that each adjacent pair of words forms a catenym. For example, 

aloha.aloha.arachnid.dog.gopher.rat.tiger

Given a dictionary of lower case words, you are to find a compound catenym that contains each of the words exactly once.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of standard input contains t, the number of test cases. Each test case begins with 3 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000 - the number of words in the dictionary. n distinct dictionary words follow; each word is a string of between 1 and 20 lowercase letters on a line by itself.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output a line giving the lexicographically least compound catenym that contains each dictionary word exactly once. Output "***" if there is no solution. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">2
