<h2>Description</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>You are given a rectangular cake of integral dimensions <i>w</i> × <i>h</i>. Your goal is to divide this cake into <i>m</i> rectangular pieces of integral dimensions such that the area of the largest piece is minimal. Each cut must be a straight line parallel to one of the sides of the original cake and must divide a piece of cake into two new pieces of positive area. Note that since a cut divides only a single piece, exactly <i>m</i> − 1 cuts are needed.</p><p>If <i>w</i> = 4, <i>h</i> = 4, and <i>m</i> = 4, then the following cuts minimize the area of the largest piece:</p><center><img src="images/2951_1.gif"> </center><p>However, if <i>w</i> = 4, <i>h</i> = 4, and <i>m</i> = 3, then the following cuts are optimal:</p><center><img src="images/2951_2.gif"></center></span><h2>Input</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The input test file will contain multiple test cases, each of which consists of three integers <i>w</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>m</i> separated by a single space, with 1 ≤ <i>w</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>m</i> ≤ 20 and <i>m</i> ≤ <i>wh</i>. The end-of-file is marked by a test case with <i>w</i> = <i>h</i> = <i>m</i> = 0 and should not be processed.</p></span><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, write a single line with a positive integer indicating the area of the largest piece.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4 4 4
