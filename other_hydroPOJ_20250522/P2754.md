<h2>Description</h2><p>The background knowledge of this problem comes from "Similarity of necklaces". Do not worry. I will bring you all the information you need.
</p>
The little cat thinks about the problem he met again, and turns that problem into a fair new one, by putting N * (N + 1) / 2 elements into a linear list, with M = N * (N + 1) / 2 elements:

</p>
(The above table denotes Table and Pairs in description of <similarity of="" necklaces=""> after converting)
<br>
<br>One more array named "Multi" appears here. Suppose Pairs and Multi are given, the little cat's purpose is to determine an array Table with M integers that obey:

<br> 
<br>(this condition is similar with the condition
<br>
<br><img src="images/2754_3.gif"> 
<br> 
<br>that appears in the problem "Similarity of necklaces") and make
<br>
<br><img src="images/2754_4.gif">
<br> 
<br>as large as possible. What is more, we must have Low[i] &lt;= Table[i] &lt;= Up[i] for any 1 &lt;= i &lt;= M. Here Low and Up are two more arrays with M integers given to you.
<br></similarity><h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains a number of test cases. Each of the following blocks denotes a single test case. A test case starts by an integer M (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 200) and M lines followed. The i-th line followed contains four integers: Pairs[i], Multi[i], Low[i], Up[i].
</p>
Restrictions: -25 &lt;= Low[i] &lt; Up[i] &lt;= 25, 0 &lt;= Pairs[i] &lt;= 100000, 1 &lt;= Multi[i] &lt;= 20. From the input given, you may assume that there is always a solution.
<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output a single line with a single number, which is the largest
