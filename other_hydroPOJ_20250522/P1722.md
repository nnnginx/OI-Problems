<h2>Description</h2><p>We are given a sequence of N positive integers a = [a1, a2, ..., aN] on which we can perform contraction operations. 
</p>One contraction operation consists of replacing adjacent elements ai and ai+1 by their difference ai-a<sub>i+1</sub><p>. For a sequence of N integers, we can perform exactly N-1 different contraction operations, each of which results in a new (N-1) element sequence. 
</p>
Precisely, let con(a,i) denote the (N-1) element sequence obtained from [a1, a2, ..., aN] by replacing the elements ai and a<sub>i+1</sub><p> by a single integer ai-a</p><sub>i+1</sub><p> : 
</p>
<b>con(a,i) = [a1, ..., ai-1, ai-a<sub>i+1</sub>, a<sub>i+2</sub>, ..., aN]</b><p>
</p>Applying N-1 contractions to any given sequence of N integers obviously yields a single integer. 
For example, applying contractions 2, 3, 2 and 1 in that order to the sequence [12,10,4,3,5] yields 4, since : 
<pre>con([12,10,4,3,5],2) = [12,6,3,5]
<br>con([12,6,3,5]   ,3) = [12,6,-2]
<br>con([12,6,-2]    ,2) = [12,8]
<br>con([12,8]       ,1) = [4]</pre><p>
</p>Given a sequence a1, a2, ..., aN and a target number T, the problem is to find a sequence of N-1 contractions that applied to the original sequence yields T. <h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains two integers separated by blank character : the integer N, 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100, the number of integers in the original sequence, and the target integer T, -10000 &lt;= T &lt;= 10000. 
</p>The following N lines contain the starting sequence : for each i, 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N, the (i+1)<sup>st</sup><p> line of the input file contains integer ai, 1 &lt;= ai &lt;= 100. 
</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Output should contain N-1 lines, describing a sequence of contractions that transforms the original sequence into a single element sequence containing only number T. The ith line of the output file should contain a single integer denoting the i</p><sup>th</sup><p> contraction to be applied. 
</p>You can assume that at least one such sequence of contractions will exist for a given input.
