<h2>Description</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>Lily runs a repairing company that services the <i>Q</i> blocks in the city. One day the company receives <i>M</i> repair tasks, the <i>i</i>th of which occurs in block <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>, has a deadline <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> on any repairman’s arrival, which is also its starting time, and takes a single repairman <i>d<sub>i</sub></i> time to finish. Repairmen work alone on all tasks and must finish one task before moving on to another. With a map of the city in hand, Lily want to know the minimum number of repairmen that have to be assign to this day’s tasks.</p></span><h2>Input</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing <i>Q</i> and <i>M</i> (0 &lt; <i>Q</i> ≤ 20, 0 &lt; <i>M</i> ≤ 200). Then follow <i>Q</i> lines each with <i>Q</i> integers, which represent a <i>Q</i> × <i>Q</i> matrix Δ = {δ<i><sub>ij</sub></i>}, where δ<i><sub>ij</sub></i> means a bidirectional road connects the <i>i</i>th and the <i>j</i>th blocks and requires δ<i><sub>ij</sub></i> time to go from one end to another. If δ<i><sub>ij</sub></i> = −1, such a road does not exist. The matrix is symmetric and all its diagonal elements are zeroes. Right below the matrix are <i>M</i> lines describing the repairing tasks. The <i>i</i>th of these lines contains <i>p<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>t<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>d<sub>i</sub></i>. Two zeroes on a separate line come after the last test case.</p></span><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case output one line containing the minimum number of repairmen that have to be assigned.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1 2
