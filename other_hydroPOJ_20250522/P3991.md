<h2>Description</h2><p>I¡¯m out of stories. For years I¡¯ve been writing stories, some rather silly, just to make simple problems look difficult and complex problems look easy. But, alas, not for this one.
</p>You¡¯re given a non empty string made in its entirety from opening and closing braces. Your task is to find the minimum number of ¡°operations¡± needed to make the string stable. The definition for being stable is as follows:
<ol>
<br><li>An empty string is stable.</li>
<br><li>If S is stable, then {S} is also stable.</li>
<br><li>If S and T are both stable, then ST (the concatenation of the two) is also stable.</li>
<br></ol><p>
</p>All of these strings are stable: {}, {}{}, and {{}{}}; But none of these: }{, {{}{, nor {}{.
The only operation allowed on the string is to replace an opening brace with a closing brace, or visa-versa.<h2>Input</h2><p>Your program will be tested on one or more data sets. Each data set is described on a single line. The line is a non-empty string of opening and closing braces and nothing else. No string has more than 2000 braces. All sequences are of even length.
</p>The last line of the input is made of one or more ¡¯-¡¯ (minus signs.)<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print the following line:
</p>k. N
Where k is the test case number (starting at one,) and N is the minimum number of operations needed to convert the given string into a balanced one.<pre><code class="language-input1">}{
