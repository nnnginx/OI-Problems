<h2>Description</h2><p>Given a connected undirected graph, tell if its minimum spanning tree is unique.
</p>
Definition 1 (Spanning Tree): Consider a connected, undirected graph G = (V, E). A spanning tree of G is a subgraph of G, say T = (V', E'), with the following properties:
1. V' = V.
2. T is connected and acyclic.

Definition 2 (Minimum Spanning Tree): Consider an edge-weighted, connected, undirected graph G = (V, E). The minimum spanning tree T = (V, E') of G is the spanning tree that has the smallest total cost. The total cost of T means the sum of the weights on all the edges in E'.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line contains a single integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 20), the number of test cases. Each case represents a graph. It begins with a line containing two integers n and m (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100), the number of nodes and edges. Each of the following m lines contains a triple (xi, yi, wi), indicating that xi and yi are connected by an edge with weight = wi. For any two nodes, there is at most one edge connecting them.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each input, if the MST is unique, print the total cost of it, or otherwise print the string 'Not Unique!'.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">2
