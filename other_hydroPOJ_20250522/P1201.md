<h2>Description</h2><p>You are given n closed, integer intervals [ai, bi] and n integers c1, ..., cn. 
</p>Write a program that: 
reads the number of intervals, their end points and integers c1, ..., cn from the standard input, 
computes the minimal size of a set Z of integers which has at least ci common elements with interval [ai, bi], for each i=1,2,...,n, 
writes the answer to the standard output. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 50000) -- the number of intervals. The following n lines describe the intervals. The (i+1)-th line of the input contains three integers ai, bi and ci separated by single spaces and such that 0 &lt;= ai &lt;= bi &lt;= 50000 and 1 &lt;= ci &lt;= bi - ai+1. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output contains exactly one integer equal to the minimal size of set Z sharing at least ci elements with interval [ai, bi], for each i=1,2,...,n. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
