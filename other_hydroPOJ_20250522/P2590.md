<h2>Description</h2><p>One steps through integer points of the straight line. The length of a step must be nonnegative and can be by one bigger than, equal to, or by one smaller than the length of the previous step. 
</p>What is the minimum number of steps in order to get from x to y? The length of the first and the last step must be 1.<h2>Input</h2><p>Input consists of a line containing n, the number of test cases.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, a line follows with two integers: 0 &lt;= x &lt;= y &lt; 2^31. For each test case, print a line giving the minimum number of steps to get from x to y.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
