<h2>Description</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The game “The Pilots Brothers: following the stripy elephant” has a quest where a player needs to open a refrigerator.</p><p>There are 16 handles on the refrigerator door. Every handle can be in one of two states: open or closed. The refrigerator is open only when all handles are open. The handles are represented as a matrix 4х4. You can change the state of a handle in any location <b>[i, j]</b> (1 ≤ i, j ≤ 4). However, this also changes states of all handles in row <b>i</b> and all handles in column <b>j</b>.</p><p>The task is to determine the minimum number of handle switching necessary to open the refrigerator.</p></span><h2>Input</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains four lines. Each of the four lines contains four characters describing the initial state of appropriate handles. A symbol “+” means that the handle is in closed state, whereas the symbol “−” means “open”. At least one of the handles is initially closed.</p></span><h2>Output</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The first line of the input contains N – the minimum number of switching. The rest N lines describe switching sequence. Each of the lines contains a row number and a column number of the matrix separated by one or more spaces. If there are several solutions, you may give any one of them.</p></span><pre><code class="language-input1">-+--
