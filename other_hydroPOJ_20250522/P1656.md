<h2>Description</h2><p>There is a board with 100 * 100 grids as shown below. The left-top gird is denoted as (1, 1) and the right-bottom grid is (100, 100). 
</p><center><img src="images/1656_1.jpg"></center><p>
</p>We may apply three commands to the board:
<pre><br>1.	WHITE  x, y, L     // Paint a white square on the board, 
<br>                           // the square is defined by left-top grid (x, y)
<br>                           // and right-bottom grid (x+L-1, y+L-1)
<br>
<br>2.	BLACK  x, y, L     // Paint a black square on the board, 
<br>                           // the square is defined by left-top grid (x, y)
<br>                           // and right-bottom grid (x+L-1, y+L-1)
<br>
<br>3.	TEST     x, y, L    // Ask for the number of black grids 
<br>                            // in the square (x, y)- (x+L-1, y+L-1) </pre><p>
</p>In the beginning, all the grids on the board are white. We apply a series of commands to the board. Your task is to write a program to give the numbers of black grids within a required region when a TEST command is applied.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input is an integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100), representing the number of commands. In each of the following lines, there is a command. Assume all the commands are legal which means that they won't try to paint/test the grids outside the board.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each TEST command, print a line with the number of black grids in the required region.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
