<h2>Description</h2><div>YYF is a couragous scout. Now he is on a dangerous mission which is to penetrate into the enemy's base. After overcoming a series difficulties, YYF is now at the start of enemy's famous "mine road". This is a very long road, on which there are numbers of mines. At first, YYF is at step one. For each step after that, YYF will walk one step with a probability of <i>p</i>, or jump two step with a probality of 1-<i>p</i>. Here is the task, given the place of each mine, please calculate the probality that YYF can go through the "mine road" safely. </div><h2>Input</h2><div>The input contains many test cases ended with <b>EOF</b>.<br>Each test case contains two lines.<br>The First line of each test case is <i>N</i> (1 ¡Ü <i>N</i> ¡Ü 10) and <i>p</i> (0.25 ¡Ü <i>p</i> ¡Ü 0.75) seperated by a single blank, standing for the number of mines and the probability to walk one step.<br>The Second line of each test case is N integer standing for the place of N mines. Each integer is in the range of [1, 100000000]. </div><h2>Output</h2><div>For each test case, output the probabilty in a single line with the precision to 7 digits after the decimal point. </div><pre><code class="language-input1">1 0.5
