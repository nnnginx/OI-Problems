<h2>Description</h2><p>In this problem, you are given a list of words (sequence of lower case letters). From this list, find the longest chain of words w1, ..., wn such that wi is a mixed extension of w</p><sub>i-1</sub><p>. A word A is a mixed extension of another word B if A can be formed by adding one letter to B and permuting the result. For example, "ab", "bar", "crab", "cobra", and "carbon" form a chain of length 5. </p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains at least two, but no more than 10000 lines. Each line contains a word. The length of each word is at least 1 and no more than 20. All words in the input are distinct. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>Write the longest chain that can be constructed from the given words. Output each word in the chain on a separate line, starting from the first one. If there are multiple longest chains, any longest chain is acceptable. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">ab
