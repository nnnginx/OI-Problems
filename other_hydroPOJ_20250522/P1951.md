<h2>Description</h2><p>A krunched word has no vowels ("A", "E", "I", "O", and "U") and no repeated letters.  Removing vowels and letters that appear twice or more from MISSISSIPPI yields MSP.  In a krunched word, a letter appears only once, the first time it would appear in the unkrunched word.  Vowels never appear.
</p>
Krunched phrases similarly have no vowels and no repeated letters. Consider this phrase:
<pre>        RAILROAD CROSSING</pre><p>
</p>and its krunched version:
<pre>        RLD CSNG</pre><p>
</p>Blanks are krunched differently. Blanks are removed so that a krunched phrase has no blanks on its beginning or end, never has two blanks in a row, and has no blanks before punctuation.  Otherwise, blanks not removed. If we represent blanks by "_",
<pre>        MADAM_I_SAY_I_AM_ADAM__</pre><p>
</p>krunches to:
<pre>        MD_SY</pre><p>
</p>where the single remaining blank is shown by "_".

The input line has only capital letters, blanks, and the standard punctuation marks: period, comma, and question mark.<h2>Input</h2><p>A single line to be krunched.
</p><h2>Output</h2><p>A single krunched line that follows the rules above.
