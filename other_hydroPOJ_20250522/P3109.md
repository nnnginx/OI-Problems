<h2>Description</h2><p>There is an infinite square grid. Some vertices of the grid are black and other vertices are white.</p><p>A vertex <i>V</i> is called <i>inner</i> if it is both vertical-inner and horizontal-inner. A vertex <i>V</i> is called <i>horizontal-inner</i> if there are two such black vertices in the same row that <i>V</i> is located between them. A vertex <i>V</i> is called <i>vertical-inner</i> if there are two such black vertices in the same column that <i>V</i> is located between them.</p><p>On each step all white inner vertices became black while the other vertices preserve their colors. The process stops when all the inner vertices are black.</p><p>Write a program that calculates a number of black vertices after the process stops.</p><h2>Input</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The first line of the input file contains one integer number <i>n</i> (0 ¡Ü <i>n</i> ¡Ü 100 000) ¡ª number of black vertices at the beginning.</p><p>The following <i>n</i> lines contain two integer numbers each ¡ª the coordinates of different black vertices. The coordinates do not exceed 10<sup>9</sup> by their absolute values.</p></span><h2>Output</h2><p>Output the number of black vertices when the process stops. If the process does not stop, output <code>-1</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
