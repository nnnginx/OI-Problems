<h2>Description</h2><p>There is a map of a minefield. The border of the minefield is a polygon which has not got self-intersections or self-contacts. There are two points <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> outside of this minefield or on its border. You need to find the minimum length way from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>. Obviously the way can not cross the minefield. However, it may contact edges or vertices of the bounding polygon.</p><h2>Input</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The input consists of several lines. The first line contains four numbers <b>X<sub>A</sub></b>, <b>Y<sub>A</sub></b>, <b>X<sub>B</sub></b> and <b>Y<sub>B</sub></b> – the coordinates of two given points. The second line contains integer number <b>N</b>, 3 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 100 – the number of vertices of the bounding polygon. Finally, each of the next N lines contains a coordinates <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> of one polygon vertex, in the counterclockwise order. All the coordinates are integer numbers between −100000 and 100000. The numbers are separated by one or more spaces.</p></span><h2>Output</h2><p>The output consists of one line containing the length of a shortest safe way, with the accuracy 0.0001.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">0 0 5 5
