<h2>Description</h2><p>A square is a 4-sided polygon whose sides have equal length and adjacent sides form 90-degree angles. It is also a polygon such that rotating about its centre by 90 degrees gives the same polygon. It is not the only polygon with the latter property, however, as a regular octagon also has this property. 
</p>
So we all know what a square looks like, but can we find all possible squares that can be formed from a set of stars in a night sky? To make the problem easier, we will assume that the night sky is a 2-dimensional plane, and each star is specified by its x and y coordinates. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of a number of test cases. Each test case starts with the integer n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000) indicating the number of points to follow. Each of the next n lines specify the x and y coordinates (two integers) of each point. You may assume that the points are distinct and the magnitudes of the coordinates are less than 20000. The input is terminated when n = 0. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print on a line the number of squares one can form from the given stars. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
