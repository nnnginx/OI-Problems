<h2>Description</h2><p>Let S = s1 s2...s2n  be a well-formed string of parentheses. S can be encoded in two different ways:
</p>q	By an integer sequence P = p1 p2...pn where pi is the number of left parentheses before the ith right parenthesis in S (P-sequence).
q	By an integer sequence W = w1 w2...wn where for each right parenthesis, say a in S, we associate an integer which is the number of right parentheses counting from the matched left parenthesis of a up to a. (W-sequence).

Following is an example of the above encodings:
<pre><br>	S		(((()()())))
<br>	P-sequence	    4 5 6666
<br>	W-sequence	    1 1 1456
<br></pre><p>
</p>Write a program to convert P-sequence of a well-formed string to the W-sequence of the same string.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case is an integer n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 20), and the second line is the P-sequence of a well-formed string. It contains n positive integers, separated with blanks, representing the P-sequence.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output file consists of exactly t lines corresponding to test cases. For each test case, the output line should contain n integers describing the W-sequence of the string corresponding to its given P-sequence.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">2
