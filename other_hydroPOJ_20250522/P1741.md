<h2>Description</h2><p>Give a tree with n vertices,each edge has a length(positive integer less than 1001).
</p>Define dist(u,v)=The min distance between node u and v.
Give an integer k,for every pair (u,v) of vertices is called valid if and only if dist(u,v) not exceed k.
Write a program that will count how many pairs which are valid for a given tree. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k. (n&lt;=10000) The following n-1 lines each contains three integers u,v,l, which means there is an edge between node u and v of length l.
</p>The last test case is followed by two zeros.
<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case output the answer on a single line.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5 4
