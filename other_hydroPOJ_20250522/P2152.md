<h2>Description</h2><p>Country Z has N cities, which are numbered from 1 to N. Cities are connected by highways, and there is exact one path between two different cities. Recently country Z often caught fire, so the government decided to build some firehouses in some cities. Build a firehouse in city K cost W(K). W for different cities may be different. If there is not firehouse in city K, the distance between it and the nearest city which has a firehouse, can¡¯t be more than D(K). D for different cities also may be different. To save money, the government wants you to calculate the minimum cost to build firehouses.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains a single integer T representing the number of test cases. The following T blocks each represents a test case.
</p>
The first line of each block contains an integer N (1 &lt; N &lt;= 1000). The second line contains N numbers separated by one or more blanks. The I-th number means W(I) (0 &lt; W(I) &lt;= 10000). The third line contains N numbers separated by one or more blanks. The I-th number means D(I) (0 &lt;= D(I) &lt;= 10000). The following N-1 lines each contains three integers u, v, L (1 &lt;= u, v &lt;= N£¬0 &lt; L &lt;= 1000), which means there is a highway between city u and v of length L.
<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case output the minimum cost on a single line.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
