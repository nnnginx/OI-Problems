</p>Figure 1 shows a square. Each row, each column and the two diagonals can be read as a five digit prime number. The rows are read from left to right. The columns are read from top to bottom. Both diagonals are read from left to right. Write a program that constructs such squares:
<ul>
<br><li>	The prime numbers must have the same digit sum (11 in the example). 
<br></li><li>	The digit in the top left-hand corner of the square is pre-determined (1 in the example). 
<br></li><li>	A prime number may be used more than once in the same square. 
<br></li><li>	If there are several solutions, all must be presented. 
<br></li><li>	A five digit prime number cannot begin with zeros, ie 00003 is NOT a five digit prime number. </li></ul><p>
</p>
<h2>Input</h2><p>Your program is to read from standard input. First the digit sum of prime numbers and then the digit in the top left-hand corner of the square. The file contains two lines. There will always be a solution to the given test data.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Your program is to write to standard output. Output five lines for each solution found, where each line in turn consists of a five digit prime number. The solutions are sorted by the prime in the first row, then by the prime in the second row,etc. Output a blank line after each solution.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">11
