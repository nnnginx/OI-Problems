<h2>Description</h2><p>A palindrome is a string of symbols that is equal to itself when reversed. Given an input string, not necessarily a palindrome, compute the number of swaps necessary to transform the string into a palindrome. By swap we mean reversing the order of two adjacent symbols. For example, the string "mamad" may be transformed into the palindrome "madam" with 3 swaps: 
</p>swap "ad" to yield "mamda" 
swap "md" to yield "madma" 
swap "ma" to yield "madam" 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input gives n, the number of test cases. For each test case, one line of input follows, containing a string of up to 8000 lowercase letters.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Output consists of one line per test case. This line will contain the number of swaps, or "Impossible" if it is not possible to transform the input to a palindrome.
