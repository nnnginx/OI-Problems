<h2>Description</h2><p>A fractal is an object or quantity that displays self-similarity, in a somewhat technical sense, on all scales. The object need not exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales, but the same "type" of structures must appear on all scales.
</p>A box fractal is defined as below :
<ul><li>A box fractal of degree 1 is simply
<br>X
<br></li><li> A box fractal of degree 2 is
<br>X X
<br>X
<br>X X
<br></li><li>If using B(n - 1) to represent the box fractal of degree n - 1, then a box fractal of degree n is defined recursively as following
<br><pre>B(n - 1)        B(n - 1)
<br>        B(n - 1)
<br>B(n - 1)        B(n - 1)</pre></li></ul><p>
</p>Your task is to draw a box fractal of degree n.<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of several test cases. Each line of the input contains a positive integer n which is no greater than 7. The last line of input is a negative integer âˆ’1 indicating the end of input.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output the box fractal using the 'X' notation. Please notice that 'X' is an uppercase letter. Print a line with only a single dash after each test case.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
