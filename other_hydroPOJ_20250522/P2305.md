<h2>Description</h2><p>Given a base b and two non-negative base b integers p and m, compute p mod m and print the result as a base b integer. p mod m is defined as the smallest non-negative integer k such that p = a*m + k for some integer a.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>Input consists of a number of cases. Each case is represented by a line containing three unsigned integers. The first, b, is a decimal number between 2 and 10. The second, p, contains up to 1000 digits between 0 and b-1. The third, m, contains up to 9 digits between 0 and b-1. The last case is followed by a line containing 0.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print a line giving p mod m as a base-b integer.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">2 1100 101
