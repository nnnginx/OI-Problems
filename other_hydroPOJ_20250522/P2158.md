<h2>Description</h2><p>Here is a difficult mathematics problem; your job is to solve it.
</p>
Given two integer N and K, we have
A(N, K) = {a | a = (a1 a2 a3 °≠ aN),  ai  is integer and 0 &lt;= ai &lt;= K-1, i = 1,...,N}.

We define a function d = Image(a) from A(N, K) to A(N-1, K) as below:
For any a = (a1 a2 a3 ... aN), which is belonged to A(N, K), we have d = (d1 d2 ... d<sub>N-1</sub><p>) = Image(a) with di = min(ai, a</p><sub>i+1</sub><p>), i.e., di is the smaller one between ai and ai+1.
</p>
You should calculate the expression below

</p>For any element a belonged to A(N, K), the expression first obtains d = (d1 d2 ... d<sub>N-1</sub><p>) = Image(a); then gain a value by calculating (d1+1)(d2+1)...(d</p><sub>N-1</sub><p>+1). Each a corresponding to a value, and f(N, K) is just the sum of these values.
</p>
For example, If N = 2, K = 3, then A(N, K)={(00), (01), (02), (11), (10), (12), (20), (21), (22)}; the values obtained from each element in A(N, K) are 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and we can know that  f(2, 3) = 14 by adding these values.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of only one line, which contains two integer N and K (N = 2, 3, 4. And if N=2, we has 1 &lt;= K &lt;= 5000; if N=3, we has 1 &lt;= K &lt;= 1000; if N=4, we has 1 &lt;= K &lt;= 500). </p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output contains a single integer, which is the value of f(N, K). It's confirmed that the result is less than 2^63.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">2 3</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">14</code></pre><h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=POJ+Monthly">POJ Monthly</a><p>,¿Ó—ßŒ‰</p>
