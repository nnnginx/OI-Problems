<h2>Description</h2><p>N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1,000) calves try out for the Moo U gymnastics team this year, each with a positive integer height and a weight less than 100,000.  Your goal is to select a team of as many calves as possible from this group. There is only one constraint the team must satisfy: the height H and weight W of each calf on the team must obey the following inequality:
</p><center>A*(H-h) + B*(W-w) &lt;= C</center><p>
</p>where h and w are the minimum height and weight values over all calves on the team, and A, B and C are supplied positive integral constants less than 10,000.   Compute the maximum number of calves on the team.<h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer, N
</p>
* Line 2: Three space-separated integers, A, B and C

* Lines 3..N+2: Two space-separated integers: respectively the height and weight of a calf
<h2>Output</h2><p>* Line 1: One integer, the maximum number of calves on the team.
