<h2>Description</h2><p>Farmer John has N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 25,000) rectangular barns on his farm, all with sides parallel to the X and Y axes and integer corner coordinates in the range 0..1,000,000. These barns do not overlap although they may share corners and/or sides with other barns.
</p>
Since he has extra cows to milk this year, FJ would like to expand some of his barns.  A barn has room to expand if it does not share a corner or a wall with any other barn.  That is, FJ can expand a barn if all four of its walls can be pushed outward by at least some amount without bumping into another barn.  If two barns meet at a corner, neither barn can expand.

Please determine how many barns have room to expand.<h2>Input</h2><p>Line 1: A single integer, N
</p>
Lines 2..N+1: Four space-separated integers A, B, C, and D, describing one barn. The lower-left corner of the barn is at (A,B) and the upper right corner is at (C,D).<h2>Output</h2><p>Line 1: A single integer that is the number of barns that can be expanded.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5

</p>
There are 5 barns.  The first barn has its lower-left corner at (0,2) and its upper-right corner at (2,7), and so on.

Only two barns can be expanded --- the first two listed in the input. All other barns are each in contact with at least one other barn.<h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=USACO+2005+December+Gold">USACO 2005 December Gold</a>
