<h2>Description</h2><p>We are given N squares in the coordinate plane whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. All the corners have integer coordinates and the squares do not touch or overlap.
</p>You are required to count the number of squares visible from the origin point O, O = (0, 0).
A square is visible from the origin point O if there are two distinct points A and B on one of its sides such that the interior of the triangle OAB has no common points with any of the remaining squares.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains the integer N, 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000, the number of squares.
</p>Each of the following N lines describes a square by specifying integers X, Y and L separated by single blank characters, 1 &lt;= X, Y, L &lt;= 10000. X and Y are coordinates of the lower left corner (the corner with the least X and Y coordinates) and L is the side length.
<h2>Output</h2><p>The first and the only line of the output should contain the number of squares that are visible from the origin.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
