</p>Some day, Tom's father buys him a box of dominoes blocks. In the box, there are 12 different blocks, which are shown above. Tom is a boy who likes to do practice in intelligence, so he spends a whole afternoon in finishing two different rectangles with 3 * 20, which are shown below.

Tom is sure that these are the only solutions for 3 * 20, and he wants to know the number of solutions for 4 * 15, 5 * 12, ... Can you help him?

You should notice that if a solution will be the same as the other by some flip or rotate, these two solutions should be consider as the same.
<h2>Input</h2><p>There may be several test cases. Each contains a single line with two positive integers M and N, which means the shape of M * N. Here M * N = 60.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output a line contains the number of solutions.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1 60
