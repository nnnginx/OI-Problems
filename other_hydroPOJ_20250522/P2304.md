<h2>Description</h2><img align="right" src="images/2304_1.gif"><p>Now that you're back to school for another term, you need to remember how to work the combination lock on your locker. A common design is that of the Master Brand, shown at right. The lock has a dial with 40 calibration marks numbered 0 to 39. A combination consists of 3 of these numbers; for example: 15-25-8. To open the lock, the following steps are taken: 
</p><ul><li>turn the dial clockwise 2 full turns 
<br></li><li>stop at the first number of the combination 
<br></li><li>turn the dial counter-clockwise 1 full turn 
<br></li><li>continue turning counter-clockwise until the 2nd number is reached 
<br></li><li>turn the dial clockwise again until the 3rd number is reached 
<br></li><li>pull the shank and the lock will open. </li></ul><p>
</p>Given the initial position of the dial and the combination for the lock, how many degrees is the dial rotated in total (clockwise plus counter-clockwise) in opening the lock? <h2>Input</h2><p>Input consists of several test cases. For each case there is a line of input containing 4 numbers between 0 and 39. The first number is the position of the dial. The next three numbers are the combination. Consecutive numbers in the combination will be distinct. A line containing 0 0 0 0 follows the last case. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each case, print a line with a single integer: the number of degrees that the dial must be turned to open the lock.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">0 30 0 30
