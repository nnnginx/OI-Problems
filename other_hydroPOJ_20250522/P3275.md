<h2>Description</h2><p>Each of Farmer John's <i>N</i> cows (1 ¡Ü <i>N</i> ¡Ü 1,000) produces milk at a different positive rate, and FJ would like to order his cows according to these rates from the fastest milk producer to the slowest.</p><p>FJ has already compared the milk output rate for <i>M</i> (1 ¡Ü <i>M</i> ¡Ü 10,000) pairs of cows. He wants to make a list of <i>C</i> additional pairs of cows such that, if he now compares those <i>C</i> pairs, he will definitely be able to deduce the correct ordering of all <i>N</i> cows. Please help him determine the minimum value of <i>C</i> for which such a list is possible.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: </p><i>N</i><p> and </p><i>M</i><p>
</p>Lines 2..<i>M</i><p>+1: Two space-separated integers, respectively: </p><i>X</i><p> and </p><i>Y</i><p>. Both </p><i>X</i><p> and </p><i>Y</i><p> are in the range 1...</p><i>N</i><p> and describe a comparison where cow </p><i>X</i><p> was ranked higher than cow </p><i>Y</i><p>.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Line 1: A single integer that is the minimum value of </p><i>C</i><p>.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5 5

However, he needs to know whether cow 1 &gt; cow 3 to determine the cow with the second highest rank. Also, he will need one more question to determine the ordering between cow 4 and cow 5. After that, he will need to know if cow 5 &gt; cow 3 if cow 1 has higher rank than cow 3. He will have to ask three questions in order to be sure he has the rankings: "Is cow 1 &gt; cow 3?  Is cow 4 &gt; cow 5? Is cow 5 &gt; cow 3?"</p><h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=USACO+2007+March+Gold">USACO 2007 March Gold</a>
