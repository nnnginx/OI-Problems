<h2>Description</h2><p>Your task is to write a program that performs a simple form of run-length encoding, as described by the rules below. 
</p>
Any sequence of between 2 to 9 identical characters is encoded by two characters. The first character is the length of the sequence, represented by one of the characters 2 through 9. The second character is the value of the repeated character. A sequence of more than 9 identical characters is dealt with by first encoding 9 characters, then the remaining ones. 

Any sequence of characters that does not contain consecutive repetitions of any characters is represented by a 1 character followed by the sequence of characters, terminated with another 1. If a 1 appears as part of the sequence, it is escaped with a 1, thus two 1 characters are output. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of letters (both upper- and lower-case), digits, spaces, and punctuation. Every line is terminated with a newline character and no other characters appear in the input. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>Each line in the input is encoded separately as described above. The newline at the end of each line is not encoded, but is passed directly to the output. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">AAAAAABCCCC
