<h2>Description</h2><p>The inversion number of an integer sequence a1, a2, . . . , an is the number of pairs (ai, aj) that satisfy i &lt; j and ai &gt; aj . Given n and the inversion number m, your task is to find the smallest permutation of the set { 1, 2, . . . , n }, whose inversion number is exactly m.
</p>A permutation a1, a2, . . . , an is smaller than b1, b2, . . . , bn if and only if there exists an integer k such that aj = bj for 1 &lt;= j &lt; k but ak &lt; bk.<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of several test cases. Each line of the input contains two integers n and m. Both of the integers at the last line of the input is −1, which should not be processed. You may assume that 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 50000 and 0 &lt;= m &lt;= n(n − 1)/2.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print a line containing the smallest permutation as described above, separates the numbers by single spaces.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5 9
