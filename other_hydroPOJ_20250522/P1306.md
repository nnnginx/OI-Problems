<h2>Description</h2><p>Computing the exact number of ways that N things can be taken M at a time can be a great challenge when N and/or M become very large. Challenges are the stuff of contests. Therefore, you are to make just such a computation given the following: 
</p>GIVEN: 	5 &lt;= N &lt;= 100; 5 &lt;= M &lt;= 100; M &lt;= N
Compute the EXACT value of: 	C = N! / (N-M)!M!
You may assume that the final value of C will fit in a 32-bit Pascal LongInt or a C long. For the record, the exact value of 100! is: 
 93,326,215,443,944,152,681,699,238,856,266,700,490,715,968,264,381,621,        468,592,963,895,217,599,993,229,915,608,941,463,976,156,518,286,253,      697,920,827,223,758,251,185,210,916,864,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
<h2>Input</h2><p>The input to this program will be one or more lines each containing zero or more leading spaces, a value for N, one or more spaces, and a value for M. The last line of the input file will contain a dummy N, M pair with both values equal to zero. Your program should terminate when this line is read. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output from this program should be in the form: 
</p>N things taken M at a time is C exactly.
