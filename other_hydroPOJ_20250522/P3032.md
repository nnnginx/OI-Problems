<h2>Description</h2><img src="images/3032_1.png" align="right" hspace="10"><span lang="en-us"><p>The magician shuffles a small pack of cards, holds it face down and performs the following procedure:</p><ol><li>The top card is moved to the bottom of the pack. The new top card is dealt face up onto the table. It is the Ace of Spades.</li><li>Two cards are moved one at a time from the top to the bottom. The next card is dealt face up onto the table. It is the Two of Spades.</li><li>Three cards are moved one at a time¡­</li><li>This goes on until the <i>n</i>th and last card turns out to be the <i>n</i> of Spades.</li></ol><p>This impressive trick works if the magician knows how to arrange the cards beforehand (and knows how to give a false shuffle). Your program has to determine the initial order of the cards for a given number of cards, 1 ¡Ü n ¡Ü 13.</p></span><h2>Input</h2><p>On the first line of the input is a single positive integer, telling the number of test cases to follow.
