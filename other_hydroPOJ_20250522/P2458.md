<h2>Description</h2><p>It's election time. The farm is partitioned into a 5x5 grid of cow locations, each of which holds either a Holstein ('H') or Jersey ('J') cow.  The Jerseys want to create a voting district of 7 contiguous (vertically or horizontally) cow locations such that the Jerseys outnumber the Holsteins. How many ways can this be done for the supplied grid?</p><h2>Input</h2><p>* Lines 1..5: Each of the five lines contains five characters per line, each 'H' or 'J'.  No spaces are present.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>* Line 1: The number of distinct districts of 7 connected cows such that the Jerseys outnumber the Holsteins in the district.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">HHHHH
