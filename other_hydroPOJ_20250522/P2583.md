<h2>Description</h2><p>Boudreaux and Thibodeaux aren't very good at math, so they need you to write a program that can determine the second degree polynomial used to generate a given sequence of three integers. As proof that you've figured out the polynomial, they want your program to print out the next 3 integers in the sequence. 
</p>
You know that each sequence is generated by a polynomial of the form f(x) = Ax<sup>2</sup><p> + Bx + C, where A, B, and C are integers in the range (-10</p><sup>3</sup><p> &lt;= (A, B, C) &lt;= 10</p><sup>3</sup><p>). You are given the values f(0), f(1), f(2) and are to determine the values f(3), f(4), f(5). 
</p><h2>Input</h2><p>Input to this problem will consist of a (non-empty) series of up to 100 data sets. Each data set will be formatted according to the following description, and there will be no blank lines separating data sets. 
</p>
Each data set consists of a single line containing the space-separated integer values of the polynomial evaluated at 0, 1, and 2 (in that order). These values will be in the range (-10<sup>3</sup><p> &lt;= (f(0), f(1), f(2)) &lt;= 10</p><sup>3</sup><p>). </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each data set, there will be exactly one line of output containing the space-separated integer values of the polynomial evaluated at 3, 4, and 5 (in that order). These values will be in the range (-10</p><sup>4</sup><p> &lt;= (f(3), f(4), f(5)) &lt;= 10</p><sup>4</sup><p>). </p><pre><code class="language-input1">0 0 0
