<h2>Description</h2><p>Workers are going to enclose a new working region with a fence. For their convenience the enclosed area has to be as large as possible. They have N rectangular blocks to build the fence. The length of the i-th block is Li meters. All blocks have the same height of 1 meter. The workers are not allowed to break blocks into parts. All blocks must be used to build the fence.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input file contains one integer N (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 100).
</p>The following N lines describe fence blocks. Each block is represented by its length in meters (integer number, 1 &lt;= Li &lt;= 100).
<h2>Output</h2><p>Write to the output file one non-negative number S - maximal possible area of the working region (in square meters). S must be written with at least two digits after the decimal point. If it is not possible to construct the fence from the specified blocks, write 0.00.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
