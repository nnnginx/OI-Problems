<h2>Description</h2><p>Given 2 equations on the variables x and y, solve for x and y. </p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains N, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two equations, each on a separate line. An empty line separates cases. An equation consists of two or more terms separated by addition, subtraction, or equality operators. A term is an integer, or a variable name (x or y) optionally preceded by a minus sign or an integer coefficient. There is exactly one equality operator. All operators are surrounded by spaces, and there are no spaces within terms.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each case, print two lines, giving the values of x and y as rationals in simplest terms. If x or y has no unique rational value such that both equations hold, print "don't know" for its value. Print an empty line between cases. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">7

2x + 3y = 0

2x + 3y = 0

2x = 3x + -x + y
x + y = x + y

2x = -3
