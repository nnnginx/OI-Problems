</p>A time schedule is represented by a 0-1 matrix with n lines and m columns. Each line represents a person and each column an event. All the persons participating to an event have a one in the corresponding entry of their line. Persons not attending the event have a zero entry in that column. Events occur consecutively. 
<b>Problem </b><p>
</p>Problem Write a program that finds a smart permutation of the events where each person attends all its events in a row. In other words, permute the columns of the matrix so that all ones are consecutive in each line. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input consists in the number n&lt;=400 of lines. The second line contains m&lt;=400 , the number of columns. Then comes the n lines of the matrix. Each line consists in m characters `0' or `1'. 
</p>
The input matrix is chosen so that there exists only one smart permutation which preserves column 0 in position 0. To make things easier, any two columns share few common one entries. <h2>Output</h2><p>The output consists of m numbers indicating the smart permutation of the columns. The first number must be 0 as column 0 does not move. The second number indicate the index (in the input matrix) of the second column, and so on. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
