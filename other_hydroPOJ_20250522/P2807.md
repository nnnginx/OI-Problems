<h2>Description</h2><p>Bingo is a game in which players try to form patterns on a 5 x 5 grid (or card). Each column on the card is represented by a letter in the game's namesake: B, I, N, G, or O. Each square on the grid contains a number. Players mark numbers as they are chosen randomly until a person has a card with a winning pattern marked (or bingo). An exception to this is the center square in the grid, which is a free spot and is already marked for all players at the beginning of each game. The possible numbers called are 1-75, inclusive, with each set of fifteen numbers corresponding to a letter: B for 1-15, I for 16-30, N for 31-45, G for 46-60, and O for 61-75. 
</p>
Given the amount of numbers for each letter already called and information used to determine the set of winning patterns, write a program to determine the fewest amount of numbers that still need to be called for a possible bingo. 

<h2>Input</h2><p>Input to this problem will begin with a line containing a single integer n indicating the number of data sets. The first line in each data set will be in the format B I N G O X Y where: 
</p><ol><li>B is the amount of numbers in the B category that have already been called; 
<br></li><li>I is the amount of numbers in the I category that have already been called; 
<br></li><li>N is the amount of numbers in the N category that have already been called; 
<br></li><li>G is the amount of numbers in the G category that have already been called; 
<br></li><li>O is the amount of numbers in the O category that have already been called; 
<br></li><li>X (where 1 &lt;= X &lt;= 19) is the number of input patterns (the winning patterns are described through combinations of the input patterns); 
<br></li><li>and Y (where 1 &lt;= Y &lt;= minimum (5, X)) is the minimum number of input patterns that must be combined to form a winning pattern. </li></ol><p>The next 5 lines in each data set will be a series of 5 x 5 grids of the input patterns in a format where X represents a square that must be marked and O represents a square that does not have to be marked. Using the input patterns and Y given above, the entire set of winning patterns can be determined. 
</p>For example, given an X of 4, a Y of 2, and a set of input patterns as follows: 
<pre>XXOOO OOOXX OOOOO OOOOO
<br>XXOOO OOOXX OOOOO OOOOO
<br>OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO
<br>OOOOO OOOOO XXOOO OOOXX
<br>OOOOO OOOOO XXOOO OOOXX</pre><p>the set of winning patterns (of which only one must be marked to have a bingo) is: 
</p><pre>XXOXX XXOOO XXOOO OOOXX OOOXX OOOOO
<br>XXOXX XXOOO XXOOO OOOXX OOOXX OOOOO
<br>OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO OOOOO
<br>OOOOO XXOOO OOOXX XXOOO OOOXX XXOXX
<br>OOOOO XXOOO OOOXX XXOOO OOOXX XXOXX</pre><p>
</p>
<h2>Output</h2><p>For each data set, output a single line containing the fewest amount of numbers that still need to be called to form a bingo.
