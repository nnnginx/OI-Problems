<h2>Description</h2><p>Here¡¯s a simple puzzle: Move one stick in the figure below to make the equation correct.</p><div align="center"><img src="images/3515_1.png"></div><p>Easy, right? Here¡¯s the solution:</p><div align="center"><img src="images/3515_2.png"></div><p></p><p>Write a program to solve similar puzzles knowing that:</p><p></p><ol><li>Each puzzle is made of a left operand, an operator, a right operand, an equal sign, and a result. The two operands and the result are numbers, made of one or more digits, and is less than 2<sup>31</sup>.</li><li>The operator and the equal sign cannot be changed. You¡¯re only allowed to move sticks making up the digits.</li><li>You can neither remove digits completely nor introduce new ones. (i.e. You can only <i>alter the digits</i>.)</li><li>Leading zeros are allowed in both the input and output. Leading zeros in the output must be printed.</li><li>Each puzzle specifies the number of required moves. Your solution must move as many sticks as specified. A stick is moved at most once; It cannot be moved again. If a stick is moved, its original place must remain vacant. (i.e. you cannot move another stick to that place.)</li><li>When solving a puzzle involving division, the division must be an <i>exact integer division</i>, i.e. no remainder.</li><li>Digits are ¡°written¡± as follows:<div align="center"><img src="images/3515_3.png"></div></li></ol><h2>Input</h2><p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each test case is specified on a single line using the following format:</p><p align="center"><i>A</i> ¡Ñ <i>B</i> = <i>R</i> (<i>n</i>)</p><p>where <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>R</i> are sequences of one or more digits, but no more than nine digits. ¡Ñ is one of the four operators: <tt>+</tt> <tt>-</tt> <tt>*</tt> <tt>/</tt>. <i>n</i> is a natural number representing the number of sticks to move. One or more spaces separate <i>A</i>, ¡Ñ, <i>B</i>, =, R, and (<i>n</i>).</p><p>The end of the test cases is indicated by a separate line having the word <tt>"EOF"</tt> (without the quotes).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each puzzle, your program must print one line of the form:</p><p><tt>k. result</tt></p><p>Where <tt>k</tt> is the puzzle number (starting at 1), and <tt>result</tt> is the equation after solving the puzzle. <tt>result</tt> includes no spaces.</p><p>In the case of multiple solutions, print just one. If the puzzle can¡¯t be solved, print <tt>"UNSOLVABLE"</tt> (without the quotes) as the <tt>result</tt>.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">6 + 1 = 12 (1)
