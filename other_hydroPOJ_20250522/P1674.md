<h2>Description</h2><p>Given a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, we can always get the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., n by swapping pairs of numbers. For example, if the initial sequence is 2, 3, 5, 4, 1, we can sort them in the following way:
</p>
2 3 5 4 1
1 3 5 4 2
1 3 2 4 5
1 2 3 4 5

Here three swaps have been used. The problem is, given a specific permutation, how many swaps we needs to take at least. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line contains a single integer t (1 &lt;= t &lt;= 20) that indicates the number of test cases. Then follow the t cases. Each case contains two lines. The first line contains the integer n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10000), and the second line gives the initial permutation.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, the output will be only one integer, which is the least number of swaps needed to get the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., n from the initial permutation. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">2
