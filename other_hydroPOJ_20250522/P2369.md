<h2>Description</h2><p>We remind that the permutation of some final set is a one-to-one mapping of the set onto itself. Less formally, that is a way to reorder elements of the set. For example, one can define a permutation of the set {1,2,3,4,5} as follows:

</p>This record defines a permutation P as follows: P(1) = 4, P(2) = 1, P(3) = 5, etc.
What is the value of the expression P(P(1))? It¡¯s clear, that P(P(1)) = P(4) = 2. And P(P(3)) = P(5) = 3. One can easily see that if P(n) is a permutation then P(P(n)) is a permutation as well. In our example (believe us)
<img src="images/2369_2.jpg"><p>   
</p>It is natural to denote this permutation by P2(n) = P(P(n)). In a general form the defenition is as follows: P(n) = P1(n), Pk(n) = P(Pk-1(n)). Among the permutations there is a very important one ¡ª that moves nothing:

</p>It is clear that for every k the following relation is satisfied: (EN)k = EN. The following less trivial statement is correct (we won't prove it here, you may prove it yourself incidentally): Let P(n) be some permutation of an N elements set. Then there exists a natural number k, that Pk = EN. The least natural k such that Pk = EN is called an order of the permutation P. 
The problem that your program should solve is formulated now in a very simple manner: "Given a permutation find its order."<h2>Input</h2><p>In the first line of the standard input an only natural number N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000) is contained, that is a number of elements in the set that is rearranged by this permutation. In the second line there are N natural numbers of the range from 1 up to N, separated by a space, that define a permutation ¡ª the numbers P(1), P(2),¡­, P(N).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>You should write an only natural number to the standard output, that is an order of the permutation. You may consider that an answer shouldn't exceed 10</p><sup>9</sup><p>.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
