<h2>Description</h2><p>Consider an arbitrary sequence of integers. One can place + or - operators between integers in the sequence, thus deriving different arithmetical expressions that evaluate to different values. Let us, for example, take the sequence: 17, 5, -21, 15. There are eight possible expressions: 17 + 5 + -21 + 15 = 16  
</p>17 + 5 + -21 - 15 = -14  
17 + 5 - -21 + 15 = 58  
17 + 5 - -21 - 15 = 28  
17 - 5 + -21 + 15 = 6  
17 - 5 + -21 - 15 = -24  
17 - 5 - -21 + 15 = 48  
17 - 5 - -21 - 15 = 18  
We call the sequence of integers divisible by K if + or - operators can be placed between integers in the sequence in such way that resulting value is divisible by K. In the above example, the sequence is divisible by 7 (17+5+-21-15=-14) but is not divisible by 5. 

You are to write a program that will determine divisibility of sequence of integers. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input file contains two integers, N and K (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000, 2 &lt;= K &lt;= 100) separated by a space. 
</p>The second line contains a sequence of N integers separated by spaces. Each integer is not greater than 10000 by it's absolute value. 
<h2>Output</h2><p>Write to the output file the word "Divisible" if given sequence of integers is divisible by K or "Not divisible" if it's not. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">4 7
