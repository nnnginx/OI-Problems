<h2>Description</h2><p>Let G be a weighted graph, i.e., every edge in G is associated with a nonnegative integer weight. The length of a path is the sum of edge weights in the path. A shortest path between vertices r and s in G, denoted by P</p><sub>G</sub><p>(r, s), is defined as a path with the shortest length from r to s. The distance between vertices r and s, denoted by d</p><sub>G</sub><p>(r, s), is the length of the shortest path P</p><sub>G</sub><p>(r, s). For two vertices in a connected graph, there exists at least one shortest path between them. Let e = (u, v) be an edge in P</p><sub>G</sub><p>(r, s) with v closer to s than u (v may be s). Let G - e denote the subgraph obtained by removing edge e from G. A detour from u is the shortest path from u to s in G - e, or P</p><sub>G-e</sub><p>(u, s). Edge e is a detour -critical edge in P</p><sub>G</sub><p>(r, s) if the removal of e results in the maximum distance increment from u to s. In other words, if e is a detour -critical edge in P</p><sub>G</sub><p>(r, s), then d</p><sub>G-e</sub><p>(u, s) - d</p><sub>G</sub><p>(u, s) is maximum among all edges in P</p><sub>G</sub><p>(r, s). The longest detour problem is to find the maximum distance increment of a shortest path.

For example, see Figure 4. P<sub>G</sub><p>(4, 1) =&lt; 4, 3, 2, 1 &gt; is the shortest path from vertex 4 to vertex 1. Path &lt; 4, 6, 1 &gt; is the detour from vertex 4 to vertex 1 if edge (4, 3) is removed. Path &lt; 3, 5, 1 &gt; is the detour from vertex 3 to vertex 1 if edge (3, 2) is removed. Path &lt; 2, 5, 1 &gt; is the detour from vertex 2 to vertex 1 if edge (2, 1) is removed. The detour -critical edge in P</p><sub>G</sub><p>(4, 1) is not edge (4, 3) or edge (2, 1) but edge (3, 2) since d</p><sub>G-(3,2)</sub><p>(3, 1) - d</p><sub>G</sub><p>(3, 1) = 600 - 200 = 400 is greater than d</p><sub>G-(4,3)</sub><p>(4, 1) - d</p><sub>G</sub><p>(4, 1) = 500 - 300 = 200 and d</p><sub>G-(2,1)</sub><p>(2, 1) - d</p><sub>G</sub><p>(2, 1) = 200 - 100 = 100.

The algorithm for finding detours, as well as determining the detour-critical edges, is important from the viewpoint of network management. Due to a sudden edge failure

from some vertex, the message must be retransmitted through a detour from the vertex adjacent to the faulty edge.

Suppose that we have several networks. Each network is connected and contains at most n vertices, where 3 &lt;= n &lt;= 100. Assume now that you are hired to serve as a

network administrator and have to determine the maximum distance increment caused by a detour-critical edge of a given shortest path for each network.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains an integer indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, where 3 &lt;= n &lt;= 100. The following n lines represent the adjacency matrix of a network. An adjacency matrix of a network G with n vertices, denoted by A(G) = [w</p><sub>u,v</sub><p>], is an n * n matrix such that w</p><sub>u,v</sub><p> &gt; 0 if (u, v) is an edge of G, and w</p><sub>u,v</sub><p>= 0 otherwise, where w</p><sub>u,v</sub><p> in a nonnegative integer. Note that any two elements in each line of an adjacency matrix are separated by a space. The last line of each test case represents the sequence of vertices in a given shortest path in which there is also a space between two vertices. Note that the first and the last vertices denote the source and the destination vertices, respectively. For example, the adjacency matrix of the graph in Figure 4 is shown in test case 3 of the sample input.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output the maximum distance increment caused by the detour-critical edge of the given shortest path in one line.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
