</p>There is no difference between Heads/Tails and Tails/Heads. As you can see, the odds are stacked in Player A's favor. At the beginning of the game, each player has 0 points, and points accumulate as the game progresses. At the
end of the game, whichever player has the most points wins.
You must write a program that determines the probability that Player A will win, Player B will win, or they will tie, after a certain number of rounds. Assume that the coins are fair, i.e. that heads and tails are equally likely.
<h2>Input</h2><p>There is no input file for this problem.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Output a table that lists the probability that Player A will win, B will win, or they will tie, after each round for 1 to 20 rounds. The output for rounds 1 through 3 is given below.
</p>Probabilities must be expressed as a percent, with 4 places after the decimal.<pre><code class="language-input1"></code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">Round   A wins    B wins    Tie
