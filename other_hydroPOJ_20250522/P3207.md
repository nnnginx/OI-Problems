Evil panda claims that he is connecting m pairs of points. To connect two points, liympanda either places the link entirely inside the circle or entirely outside the circle. Now liympanda tells Ikki no two links touch inside/outside the circle, except on the boundary. He wants Ikki to figure out whether this is possible…</p><p>Despaired at the minesweeping game just played, Ikki is totally at a loss, so he decides to write a program to help him.</p></span><h2>Input</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The input contains exactly one test case.</p><p>In the test case there will be a line consisting of of two integers: <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> (<i>n</i> ≤ 1,000, <i>m</i> ≤ 500). The following <i>m</i> lines each contain two integers <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>b<sub>i</sub></i>, which denote the endpoints of the <i>i</i>th wire. Every point will have at most one link.</p></span><h2>Output</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>Output a line, either “<code>panda is telling the truth...</code>” or “<code>the evil panda is lying again</code>”.</p></span><pre><code class="language-input1">4 2
