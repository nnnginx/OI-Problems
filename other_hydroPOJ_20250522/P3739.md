<h2>Description</h2><div><p>There are some points and lines parellel to x-axis or y-axis on the plane. If arbitrary chosen two lines parallel to x-axis and two lines parallel to y-axis, one rectangle, or sometimes a square, will be formed. If a square is formed and there is one or more point in the square or on the side of the square, the square is called a "special square". Please find the number of special squares. </p></div><h2>Input</h2><div><p>The 1st line contains three positive integer n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub> and n<sub>3</sub>. n1 stands for the number of lines parallel to x-axis, n2 stands for the number of lines parallel to y-axis, n3 stands for the number of points.(0&lt;n1, n2, n3¡Ü1000)<br>Each of the 2nd line to (n1+1)th line gives an integer y_i (0¡Üy_i¡Ü1000), means a line with equation y=y_i.<br>Each of the (n<sub>1</sub>+2)th line to (n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>+1)th line gives an integer x_j (0¡Üx_j¡Ü1000), means a line with equation x=x_j.<br>Each of the last three lines gives two integers px_k and py_k (0¡Üpx_k,py_k¡Ü1000), means a point with coordinate (px_k, py_k). </p></div><h2>Output</h2><p>Output one line containing an integer specifies the number of special squares. The test data ensures that the result is less than 2^31</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4 4 3
