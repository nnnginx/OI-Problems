<h2>Description</h2><p>For this problem, you will write a program that reads in a sequence of 32-bit signed integers.  After each odd-indexed value is read, output the median (middle value) of the elements received so far. </p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ¡Ü P ¡Ü 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow.  The first line of each data set contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by an odd decimal integer M, (1 ¡Ü M ¡Ü 9999), giving the total number of signed integers to be processed.  The remaining line(s) in the dataset consists of the values, 10 per line, separated by a single space.  The last line in the dataset may contain less than 10 values. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each data set the first line of output contains the data set number, a single space and the number of medians output (which should be one-half the number of input values plus one).  The output medians will be on the following lines, 10 per line separated by a single space.  The last line may have less than 10 elements, but at least 1 element. There should be no blank lines in the output.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
