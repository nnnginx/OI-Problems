<h2>Description</h2><p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game for two people. Each participant holds out either a fist (rock), open hand (paper), or two-finger V (scissors). If both players show the same gesture, they try again. They continue until there are two different gestures. The winner is then determined according to the table below:
</p>
<center><table><tbody><tr><td>Rock</td><td>beats</td><td>Scissors</td></tr><tr><td>Paper</td><td>beats</td><td>Rock</td></tr><tr><td>Scissors</td><td>beats</td><td>Paper</td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
</p>
Your task is to take a list of symbols representing the gestures of two players and determine how many games each player wins.
In the following example:
<pre style="padding-left: 30px"><br>Turn     : 1 2 3 4 5
<br>Player 1 : R R S R S
<br>Player 2 : S R S P S
<br></pre><p>
</p>Player 1 wins at Turn 1 (Rock beats Scissors), Player 2 wins at Turn 4 (Paper beats Rock), and all the other turns are ties.<h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains between 1 and 20 pairs of lines, the first for Player 1 and the second for Player 2. Both player lines contain the same number of symbols from the set {'R', 'P', 'S'}. The number of symbols per line is between 1 and 75, inclusive. A pair of lines each containing the single character 'E' signifies the end of the input.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each pair of input lines, output a pair of output lines as shown in the sample output, indicating the number of games won by each player.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">RRSRS
