<h2>Description</h2><p>A set of n 1-dimensional items have to be packed in identical bins. All bins have exactly the same length l and each item i has length li&lt;=l . We look for a minimal number of bins q such that 
</p><ul><li>each bin contains at most 2 items, 
<br></li><li>each item is packed in one of the q bins, 
<br></li><li>the sum of the lengths of the items packed in a bin does not exceed l . </li></ul><p>
</p>You are requested, given the integer values n , l , l1 , ..., ln , to compute the optimal number of bins q . 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains the number of items n (1&lt;=n&lt;=10</p><sup>5</sup><p>) . The second line contains one integer that corresponds to the bin length l&lt;=10000 . We then have n lines containing one integer value that represents the length of the items. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>Your program has to write the minimal number of bins required to pack all items. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">10
