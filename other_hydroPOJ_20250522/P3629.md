<h2>Description</h2><div><p>Bessie is playing a card game with her <i>N</i>-1 (2 ¡Ü <i>N</i> ¡Ü 100) cow friends using a deck with <i>K</i> (<i>N</i> ¡Ü <i>K</i> ¡Ü 100,000; <i>K</i> is a multiple of <i>N</i>) cards. The deck contains <i>M</i> = <i>K</i>/<i>N</i> "good" cards and <i>K</i>-<i>M</i> "bad" cards. Bessie is the dealer and, naturally, wants to deal herself all of the "good" cards. She loves winning.</p><p>Her friends suspect that she will cheat, though, so they devise a dealing system in an attempt to prevent Bessie from cheating. They tell her to deal as follows:</p><p>1. Start by dealing the card on the top of the deck to the cow to her right</p><p>2. Every time she deals a card, she must place the next <i>P</i> (1 ¡Ü <i>P</i> ¡Ü 10) cards on the bottom of the deck; and</p><p>3. Continue dealing in this manner to each player sequentially in a counterclockwise manner</p><p>Bessie, desperate to win, asks you to help her figure out where she should put the "good" cards so that she gets all of them. Notationally, the top card is card #1, next card is #2, and so on.</p></div><h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: <i>N</i>, <i>K</i>, and <i>P</i></p><h2>Output</h2><p>* Lines 1..<i>M</i>: Positions from top in ascending order in which Bessie should place "good" cards, such that when dealt, Bessie will obtain all good cards.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3 9 2</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">3
