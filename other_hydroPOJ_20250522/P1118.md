<h2>Description</h2><p>"How am I ever going to solve this problem?" said the pilot. 
</p>
Indeed, the pilot was not facing an easy task. She had to drop packages at specific points scattered in a dangerous area. Furthermore, the pilot could only fly over the area once in a straight line, and she had to fly over as many points as possible. All points were given by means of integer coordinates in a two-dimensional space. The pilot wanted to know the largest number of points from the given set that all lie on one line. Can you write a program that calculates this number? 


Your program has to be efficient! 
<h2>Input</h2><p>Input consist several case,First line of the each case is an integer N ( 1 &lt; N &lt; 700 ),then follow N pairs of integers. Each pair of integers is separated by one blank and ended by a new-line character. The input ended by N=0.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>output one integer for each input case ,representing the largest number of points that all lie on one line. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
