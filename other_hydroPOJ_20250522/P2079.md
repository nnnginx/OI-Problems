<h2>Description</h2><p>Given n distinct points on a plane, your task is to find the triangle that have the maximum area, whose vertices are from the given points.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n, indicating the number of points on the plane. Each of the following n lines contains two integer xi and yi, indicating the ith points. The last line of the input is an integer −1, indicating the end of input, which should not be processed. You may assume that 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 50000 and −10</p><sup>4</sup><p> &lt;= xi, yi &lt;= 10</p><sup>4</sup><p> for all i = 1 . . . n.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print a line containing the maximum area, which contains two digits after the decimal point. You may assume that there is always an answer which is greater than zero.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
