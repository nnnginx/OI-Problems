<h2>Description</h2><p>The player starts with a prize of $1, and is asked a sequence of n questions. For each question, he may 
</p><ul><li>quit and keep his prize. 
<br></li><li>answer the question. If wrong, he quits with nothing. If correct, the prize is doubled, and he continues with the next question. </li></ul><p>
</p>After the last question, he quits with his prize. The player wants to maximize his expected prize. 
Once each question is asked, the player is able to assess the probability p that he will be able to answer it. For each question, we assume that p is a random variable uniformly distributed over the range t .. 1. <h2>Input</h2><p>Input is a number of lines, each with two numbers: an integer 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 30, and a real 0 &lt;= t &lt;= 1. Input is terminated by a line containing 0 0. This line should not be processed. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each input n and t, print the player's expected prize, if he plays the best strategy. Output should be rounded to three fractional digits. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">1 0.5
