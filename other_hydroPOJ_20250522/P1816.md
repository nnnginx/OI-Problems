<h2>Description</h2><p>A word is a string of lowercases. A word pattern is a string of lowercases, '?'s and '*'s. In a pattern, a '?' matches any single lowercase, and a '*' matches none or more lowercases.
</p>
There are many word patterns and some words in your hand. For each word, your task is to tell which patterns match it.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains two integers N (0 &lt; N &lt;= 100000) and M (0 &lt; M &lt;=100), representing the number of word patterns and the number of words. Each of the following N lines contains a word pattern, assuming all the patterns are numbered from 0 to N-1. After those, each of the last M lines contains a word.
</p>
You can assume that the length of patterns will not exceed 6, and the length of words will not exceed 20.
<h2>Output</h2><p>For each word, print a line contains the numbers of matched patterns by increasing order. Each number is followed by a single blank. If there is no pattern that can match the word, print "Not match".</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5 4
