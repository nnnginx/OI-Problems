<h2>Description</h2><p>Suppose you are reading byte streams from any device, representing IP addresses. Your task is to convert a 32 characters long sequence of '1s' and '0s' (bits) to a dotted decimal format. A dotted decimal format for an IP address is form by grouping 8 bits at a time and converting the binary representation to decimal representation. Any 8 bits is a valid part of an IP address. To convert binary numbers to decimal numbers remember that both are positional numerical systems, where the first 8 positions of the binary systems are:

<br>128 64  32  16  8   4   2   1 </pre><p>
</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input will have a number N (1&lt;=N&lt;=9) in its first line representing the number of streams to convert. N lines will follow.   </p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output must have N lines with a doted decimal IP address. A dotted decimal IP address is formed by grouping 8 bit at the time and converting the binary representation to decimal representation. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
