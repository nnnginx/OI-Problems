<h2>Description</h2><p>Given n objects you'd have to tell how many different groups can be chosen if r objects are taken at a time.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>Input consists of less than 100 test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n (0 &lt; n &lt;= 50), m (0 &lt;= m &lt;= n). The next line will contain the labels (numbers in the range 1 to n) of the n objects you are to choose from.  Two objects with the same label are considered equivalent. Then in the last line for that test case, you'd have m values for r. There will be a single space separating two consecutive numbers in a line. Input is terminated by a test case where n=0, you must not process this test case.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print the test case number. And for each query number r, print the number of different groups that can be formed if r objects are taken from the given n objects. You can assume that for all input cases, the output will always fit in a 64-bit unsigned integer and (0&lt;=r&lt;=n).</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5 2
