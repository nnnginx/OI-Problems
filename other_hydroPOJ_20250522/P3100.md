<h2>Description</h2><p>Given positive integers B and N, find an integer A such that A<sup>N</sup> is as close as possible to B. (The result A is an approximation to the Nth root of B.) Note that A<sup>N</sup> may be less than, equal to, or greater than B.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of one or more pairs of values for B and N. Each pair appears on a single line, delimited by a single space. A line specifying the value zero for both B and N marks the end of the input. The value of B will be in the range 1 to 1,000,000 (inclusive), and the value of N will be in the range 1 to 9 (inclusive).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each pair B and N in the input, output A as defined above on a line by itself.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4 3
