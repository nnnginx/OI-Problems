<h2>Description</h2><div><p>In year 2008 of the Cosmic Calendar, the Aliens send a huge armada towards the Earth seeking after conquest. The humans now depend on their ultimate weapon to retain their last hope of survival. The weapon, while capable of creating a continuous, closed and convex lethal region in the space and annihilating everything enclosed within, unfortunately exhausts upon each launch a tremendous amount of energy which is proportional to the surface area of the lethal region. </p><p>Given the positions of all battleships in the Aliens' armada, your task is to calculate the minimum amount of energy required to destroy the armada with a single launch of the ultimate weapon. You need to report the surface area of the lethal region only.</p></div><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line contains one number <i>N</i> -- the number of battleships.(1 ¡Ü <i>N</i> ¡Ü 500) <br>Following <i>N</i> lines each contains three integers presenting the position of one battleship.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>The minimal area rounded to three decimal places.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
