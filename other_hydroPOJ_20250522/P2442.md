<h2>Description</h2><p>Given m sequences, each contains n non-negative integer. Now we may select one number from each sequence to form a sequence with m integers. It's clear that we may get n ^ m this kind of sequences. Then we can calculate the sum of numbers in each sequence, and get n ^ m values. What we need is the smallest n sums. Could you help us?</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line is an integer T, which shows the number of test cases, and then T test cases follow. The first line of each case contains two integers m, n (0 &lt; m &lt;= 100, 0 &lt; n &lt;= 2000). The following m lines indicate the m sequence respectively. No integer in the sequence is greater than 10000.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print a line with the smallest n sums in increasing order, which is separated by a space.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
