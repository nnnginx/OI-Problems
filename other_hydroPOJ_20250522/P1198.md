<h2>Description</h2><p>Solitaire is a game played on a chessboard 8x8. The rows and columns of the chessboard are numbered from 1 to 8, from the top to the bottom and from left to right respectively. 
</p>
There are four identical pieces on the board. In one move it is allowed to: 
<ul>
<br><li>move a piece to an empty neighboring field (up, down, left or right), 
<br></li><li>jump over one neighboring piece to an empty field (up, down, left or right). 
<br></li></ul><p>
</p><center><img src="images/1198_1.jpg"></center><p>
</p>There are 4 moves allowed for each piece in the configuration shown above. As an example let's consider a piece placed in the row 4, column 4. It can be moved one row up, two rows down, one column left or two columns right. 
Write a program that: 
<ul>
<br><li>reads two chessboard configurations from the standard input, 
<br></li><li>verifies whether the second one is reachable from the first one in at most 8 moves, 
<br></li><li>writes the result to the standard output. 
<br></li></ul><h2>Input</h2><p>Each of two input lines contains 8 integers a1, a2, ..., a8 separated by single spaces and describes one configuration of pieces on the chessboard. Integers a2j-1 and a2j (1 &lt;= j &lt;= 4) describe the position of one piece -- the row number and the column number respectively. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output should contain one word YES if a configuration described in the second input line is reachable from the configuration described in the first input line in at most 8 moves, or one word NO otherwise. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">4 4 4 5 5 4 6 5
