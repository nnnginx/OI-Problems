<h2>Description</h2><p>Suppose you are given many poker cards. As you have already known, each card has points ranging from 1 to 13. Using these poker cards, you need to play a game on the cardboard in Figure 1. The game begins with a place called START. From START, you can walk to left or right to a rectangular box. Each box is labeled with an integer, which is the distance to START.

To place poker cards on these boxes, you must follow the rules below: (1) If you put a card with n points on a box labeled i , you got (n ∗ i) points. (2) Once you place a card on a box b, you block the paths to the boxes behind b. For example, in Figure 2, a player places a queen on the right box of distance 1, he gets 1 ∗ 12 points but the queen also blocks the paths to boxes behind it; i.e., it is not allowed to put cards on boxes behind it anymore.

Your goal: Given a number of poker cards, find a way to place them so that you will get the minimum points. For example, suppose you have 3 cards 5, 10, and K. To get the minimum points, you can place cards like Figure 3, where the total points are 1 * 13 + 2 * 5 + 2 * 10 = 43.

<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input file contains an integer n, n &lt;= 10, which represents the number of test cases. In each test case, it begins with an integer m, m &lt;= 100000,
</p>
which represents the number of poker cards. Next, each card represented by its number are listed consecutively. Note that, the numbers of ace, 2, 3, ..., K are given by integers 1, 2, 3, ..., 13, respectively. The final minimum point in each test case is less than 5000000.
<h2>Output</h2><p>List the minimum points of each test case line by line.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
