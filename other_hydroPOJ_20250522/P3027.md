<h2>Description</h2><p>Numerous are the moments I as a programmer have been frustrated by the tedious conversions between decimal numbers and hexadecimal ones. Why have we chosen 10 as a base in our everyday numerical presentations, when 16 seems so practically appealing? Obviously because everyone is not the computer geek I am. Maybe some day the world will fully realise the benefits of the hexadecimal system. In the meantime I have to learn to master the base conversions since most of the time numbers do not resemble one another in different bases.
</p>
Sometimes peculiar relationships emerge among the different base representations of numbers though. For instance, I noticed just the other day that 1040<sub>10</sub><p> * 4 = 1040</p><sub>16</sub><p>, i.e. (1*10</p><sup>3</sup><p>+0*10</p><sup>2</sup><p>+4*10</p><sup>1</sup><p>+0*10</p><sup>0</sup><p>)*4=(1*16</p><sup>3</sup><p>+0*16</p><sup>2</sup><p>+4*16</p><sup>1</sup><p>+0*16</p><sup>0</sup><p>). It made me wonder how often this is the case, that is, the digits of a number in one base, are exactly the same as the digits of a multiple of the number in another base. Formally, let B1 &lt; B2 be positive integers, and a0,a1,…,ak be integers in [0…B1-1]. For which ai’s is there a positive integer c such that

</p><h2>Input</h2><p>On the first line of input is a positive integer n telling the number of test cases that follow. Each test case is on a line of its own and consists of two integer bases B1, B2, 9 &lt;= B1 &lt; B2 &lt;= 100, and two integer range elements, r1, and r2, 0 &lt; r1 &lt; r2 &lt;= 10000. Notice that all numbers in the input are given in the base 10.
</p>
<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, there should be one row containing the largest integer i, fulfilling r1 &lt; i &lt; r2, for which there is a positive integer c such that the digits of i in the base B1, are exactly the same as the digits of i*c in the base B2. If no such integer i exists, output the text ‘Non-existent.’.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
