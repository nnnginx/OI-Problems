<h2>Description</h2><p>Let us consider an </p><b>undirected</b><p> graph G = &lt; V, E &gt;. At first there is no edge in the graph. You are to write a program to calculate the connectivity of two different vertices. Your program should maintain the functions inserting or deleting an edge.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains an integer numbers N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000) -- the number of vertices in G. The second line contains the number of commands Q (1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 20000). Then the following Q lines describe each command, and there are three kinds of commands:
</p>
I u v: Insert an edge (u, v). And we guarantee that there is no edge between nodes u and v, when you face this command.
D u v: Delete an existed edge (u, v). And we guarantee that there is an edge between nodes u and v, when you face this command.
Q u v: A querying command to ask the connectivity between nodes u and v.

You should notice that the nodes are numbered from 1 to N.
<h2>Output</h2><p>Output one line for each querying command. Print "Y" if two vertices are connected or print "N" otherwise.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
