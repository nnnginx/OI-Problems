<h2>Description</h2><p>Farmer John's farm consists of a long row of N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000)fields.  Each field contains a certain number of cows, 1 &lt;= ncows &lt;= 2000.
</p>
FJ wants to build a fence around a contiguous group of these fields in order to maximize the average number of cows per field within that block. The block must contain at least F (1 &lt;= F &lt;= N) fields, where F given as input.

Calculate the fence placement that maximizes the average, given the constraint.  
<h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and F.
</p>
* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains a single integer, the number of cows in a field. Line 2 gives the number of cows in field 1,line 3 gives the number in field 2, and so on.
<h2>Output</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer that is 1000 times the maximal average.Do not perform rounding, just print the integer that is 1000*ncows/nfields.
