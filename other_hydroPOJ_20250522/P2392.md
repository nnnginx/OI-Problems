<h2>Description</h2><p>The cows are going to space!  They plan to achieve orbit by building a sort of space elevator: a giant tower of blocks.  They have K (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 400) different types of blocks with which to build the tower.  Each block of type i has height h_i (1 &lt;= h_i &lt;= 100) and is available in quantity c_i (1 &lt;= c_i &lt;= 10).  Due to possible damage caused by cosmic rays, no part of a block of type i can exceed a maximum altitude a_i (1 &lt;= a_i &lt;= 40000).
</p>
Help the cows build the tallest space elevator possible by stacking blocks on top of each other according to the rules.<h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer, K
</p>
* Lines 2..K+1: Each line contains three space-separated integers: h_i, a_i, and c_i. Line i+1 describes block type i.<h2>Output</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer H, the maximum height of a tower that can be built</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3

From the bottom: 3 blocks of type 2, below 3 of type 1, below 6 of type 3.  Stacking 4 blocks of type 2 and 3 of type 1 is not legal, since the top of the last type 1 block would exceed height 40.<h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=USACO+2005+March+Gold">USACO 2005 March Gold</a>
