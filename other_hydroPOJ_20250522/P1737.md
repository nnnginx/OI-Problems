<h2>Description</h2><p>An undirected graph is a set V of vertices and a set of E¡Ê{V*V} edges.An undirected graph is connected if and only if for every pair (u,v) of vertices,u is reachable from v.
</p>You are to write a program that tries to calculate the number of different connected undirected graph with n vertices.
For example,there are 4 different connected undirected graphs with 3 vertices.

</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case contains an integer n, denoting the number of vertices. You may assume that 1&lt;=n&lt;=50. The last test case is followed by one zero.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case output the answer on a single line.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
