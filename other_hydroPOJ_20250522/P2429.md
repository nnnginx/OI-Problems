<h2>Description</h2><p>Given two positive integers a and b, we can easily calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b. But what about the inverse? That is: given GCD and LCM, finding a and b.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains multiple test cases, each of which contains two positive integers, the GCD and the LCM. You can assume that these two numbers are both less than 2^63.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output a and b in ascending order. If there are multiple solutions, output the pair with smallest a + b.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3 60</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">12 15</code></pre><h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=POJ+Achilles">POJ Achilles</a>
