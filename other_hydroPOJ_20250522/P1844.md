<h2>Description</h2><p>Consider the natural numbers from 1 to N. By associating to each number a sign (+ or -) and calculating the value of this expression we obtain a sum S. The problem is to determine for a given sum S the minimum number N for which we can obtain S by associating signs for all numbers between 1 to N.
</p>
For a given S, find out the minimum value N in order to obtain S according to the conditions of the problem.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The only line contains in the first line a positive integer S (0&lt; S &lt;= 100000) which represents the sum to be obtained.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output will contain the minimum number N for which the sum S can be obtained. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">12</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">7</code></pre><h2>Hint</h2><p>The sum 12 can be obtained from at least 7 terms in the following way: 12 = -1+2+3+4+5+6-7.</p><h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=Romania+OI+2002">Romania OI 2002</a>
