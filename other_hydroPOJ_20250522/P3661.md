<h2>Description</h2><div><p>The cows are trying to become better athletes, so Bessie is running on a track for exactly <i>N</i> (1 ¡Ü <i>N</i> ¡Ü 10,000) minutes. During each minute, she can choose to either run or rest for the whole minute.</p><p>The ultimate distance Bessie runs, though, depends on her 'exhaustion factor', which starts at 0. When she chooses to run in minute <i>i</i>, she will run exactly a distance of <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> (1 ¡Ü <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> ¡Ü 1,000) and her exhaustion factor will increase by 1 -- but must never be allowed to exceed <i>M</i> (1 ¡Ü <i>M</i> ¡Ü 500). If she chooses to rest, her exhaustion factor will decrease by 1 for each minute she rests. She cannot commence running again until her exhaustion factor reaches 0. At that point, she can choose to run or rest.</p><p>At the end of the <i>N</i> minute workout, Bessie's exaustion factor must be exactly 0, or she will not have enough energy left for the rest of the day.</p><p>Find the maximal distance Bessie can run.</p></div><h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: <i>N</i> and <i>M</i><br>* Lines 2..<i>N</i>+1: Line <i>i</i>+1 contains the single integer: <i>D<sub>i</sub></i> </p><h2>Output</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer representing the largest distance Bessie can run while satisfying the conditions.<br>¡¡</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5 2
