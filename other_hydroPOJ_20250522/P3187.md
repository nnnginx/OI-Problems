<h2>Description</h2><p>FJ and his cows enjoy playing a mental game. They write down the numbers from 1 to N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10) in a certain order and then sum adjacent numbers to produce a new list with one fewer number.  They repeat this until only a single number is left.  For example, one instance of the game (when N=4) might go like this:
</p>
<pre>    3   1   2   4
<br>      4   3   6
<br>        7   9
<br>         16</pre><p>Behind FJ's back, the cows have started playing a more difficult game, in which they try to determine the starting sequence from only the final total and the number N.  Unfortunately, the game is a bit above FJ's mental arithmetic capabilities.
</p>
Write a program to help FJ play the game and keep up with the cows.<h2>Input</h2><p>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and the final sum.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Line 1: An ordering of the integers 1..N that leads to the given sum.  If there are multiple solutions, choose the one that is lexicographically least, i.e., that puts smaller numbers first.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4 16</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">3 1 2 4</code></pre><h2>Hint</h2><p>Explanation of the sample:
</p>
There are other possible sequences, such as 3 2 1 4, but 3 1 2 4 is the lexicographically smallest.<h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=USACO+2006+February+Gold+%26+Silver">USACO 2006 February Gold &amp; Silver</a>
