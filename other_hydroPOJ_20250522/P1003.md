<h2>Description</h2><p>How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 <tt>+</tt> 1/3 <tt>=</tt> 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make <i>n</i> cards overhang by 1/2 <tt>+</tt> 1/3 <tt>+</tt> 1/4 <tt>+</tt> ... <tt>+</tt> 1/(<i>n</i> <tt>+</tt> 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(<i>n</i> <tt>+</tt> 1). This is illustrated in the figure below.</p><p>

</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of one or more test cases, followed by a line containing the number 0.00 that signals the end of the input. Each test case is a single line containing a positive floating-point number c whose value is at least 0.01 and at most 5.20; c will contain exactly three digits.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output the minimum number of cards necessary to achieve an overhang of at least c card lengths. Use the exact output format shown in the examples.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1.00
