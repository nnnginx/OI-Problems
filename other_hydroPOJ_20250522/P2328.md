<h2>Description</h2><p>Stan and Ollie are playing a guessing game. Stan thinks of a number between 1 and 10 and Ollie guesses what the number might be. After each guess, Stan indicates whether Ollie's guess is too high, too low, or right on. 
</p>After playing several rounds, Ollie has become suspicious that Stan cheats; that is, that he changes the number between Ollie's guesses. To prepare his case against Stan, Ollie has recorded a transcript of several games. You are to determine whether or not each transcript proves that Stan is cheating. <h2>Input</h2><p>Standard input consists of several transcripts. Each transcript consists of a number of paired guesses and responses. A guess is a line containing single integer between 1 and 10, and a response is a line containing "too high", "too low", or "right on". Each game ends with "right on". A line containing 0 follows the last transcript.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each game, output a line "Stan is dishonest" if Stan's responses are inconsistent with the final guess and response. Otherwise, print "Stan may be honest". </p><pre><code class="language-input1">10
