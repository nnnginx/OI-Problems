<h2>Description</h2><p>Alice often examines star maps where stars are represented by points in a plane and there is a Cartesian coordinate for each star. Let the Linearity of a star map be the maximum number of stars in a straight line.
</p><center><img src="images/2780_1.jpg"></center><p>
</p>For example, look at the star map shown on the figure above, the Linearity of this map is 3, because the star 1, star 2, and star 5 are within the same straight line, and there is no straight line that passes 4 stars.

You are to write a program to find the Linearity of a star map.
<h2>Input</h2><p>Input will contain multiple test cases. Each describes a star map.
</p>
For each test case, the first line of the input contains the number of stars N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000). The following N lines describe coordinates of stars (two integers X and Y per line separated by a space, 0 &lt;= X, Y &lt;= 1000). There can be only one star at one point of the plane.
<h2>Output</h2><p>Output the Linearity of the map in a single line.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
