<h2>Description</h2><p>Like everyone, cows enjoy variety.  Their current fancy is new shapes for pastures.  The old rectangular shapes are out of favor; new geometries are the favorite.
</p>
I. M. Hei, the lead cow pasture architect, is in charge of creating a triangular pasture surrounded by nice white fence rails.  She is supplied with N (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 40) fence segments (each of integer length Li (1 &lt;= Li &lt;= 40) and must arrange them into a triangular pasture with the largest grazing area.  Ms. Hei must use all the rails to create three sides of non-zero length.

Help Ms. Hei convince the rest of the herd that plenty of grazing land will be available.Calculate the largest area that may be enclosed with a supplied set of fence segments.
<h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer N
</p>
* Lines 2..N+1: N lines, each with a single integer representing one fence segment's length.  The lengths are not necessarily unique.
<h2>Output</h2><p>A single line with the integer that is the truncated integer representation of the largest possible enclosed area multiplied by 100.  Output -1 if no triangle of positive area may be constructed.
