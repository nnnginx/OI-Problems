<h2>Description</h2><p>The residents of Dingilville are trying to locate a region to build an airport. The map of the land is at hand. The map is a rectangular grid of unit squares, each identified by a pair of coordinates (x,y), where x is the horizontal (west-east) and y is the vertical (south-north) coordinate. The height of every square is shown on the map. 
</p>
Your task is to find a rectangular region of squares with the largest area (i.e. a rectangular region consisting of the largest number of squares) such that 
1.the height difference between the highest and the lowest squares of the region is less than or equal to a given limit C, and 
2.the width (i.e. the number of squares along the west-east direction) of the region is at most 100.

In case there is more than one such region you are required to report only one of them.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line contains three integers: U, V and C. 
</p>Each of the following V lines contains the integers Hxy for x = 1,...,U. More specifically, Hxy occurs as the x'th number on the (V-y+2)'th input line. 
a.1 &lt;= U &lt;= 700, 1 &lt;= V &lt;= 700 where U and V designate the dimensions of the map. More specifically, U is the number of squares in the west-east direction, and V, in the south-north direction. 
b.0 &lt;= C &lt;= 10
c.-30,000 &lt;= Hxy  &lt;= 30,000 where the integer Hxy is the height of the square at coordinates (x, y), 1 &lt;= x &lt;= U, 1 &lt;= y &lt;= V.
d.The southwest corner square of the map has the coordinates (1,1) and the northeast corner has the coordinates (U,V).<h2>Output</h2><p>Output the largest area.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">10 15 4
