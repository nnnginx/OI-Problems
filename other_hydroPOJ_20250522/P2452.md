<h2>Description</h2><p>Xuanxuan has n sticks of different length. One day, she puts all her sticks in a line, represented by S1, S2, S3, ...Sn. After measuring the length of each stick Sk (1 &lt;= k &lt;= n), she finds that for some sticks Si and Sj (1&lt;= i &lt; j &lt;= n), each stick placed between Si and Sj is longer than Si but shorter than Sj.
</p>
Now given the length of S1, S2, S3, ¡­Sn, you are required to find the maximum value j - i.<h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains multiple test cases. Each case contains two lines.
</p>Line 1: a single integer n (n &lt;= 50000), indicating the number of sticks.
Line 2: n different positive integers (not larger than 100000), indicating the length of each stick in order. <h2>Output</h2><p>Output the maximum value j - i in a single line. If there is no such i and j, just output -1.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
