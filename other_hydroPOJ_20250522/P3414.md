<h2>Description</h2><p>You are given two pots, having the volume of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> liters respectively. The following operations can be performed:</p><ol><li>FILL(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fill the pot <b>i</b> (1 ¡Ü <b>i </b>¡Ü 2) from the tap;</li><li>DROP(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; empty the pot <b>i</b> to the drain;</li><li>POUR(i,j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pour from pot <b>i</b> to pot <b>j</b>; after this operation either the pot <b>j</b> is full (and there may be some water left in the pot <b>i</b>), or the pot <b>i</b> is empty (and all its contents have been moved to the pot <b>j</b>).</li></ol><p>Write a program to find the shortest possible sequence of these operations that will yield exactly <b>C</b> liters of water in one of the pots.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>On the first and only line are the numbers <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b>. These are all integers in the range from 1 to 100 and <b>C</b>¡Ümax(<b>A</b>,<b>B</b>).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>The first line of the output must contain the length of the sequence of operations <b>K</b>. The following <b>K</b> lines must each describe one operation. If there are several sequences of minimal length, output any one of them. If the desired result can¡¯t be achieved, the first and only line of the file must contain the word ¡®<b>impossible</b>¡¯.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3 5 4</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">6
