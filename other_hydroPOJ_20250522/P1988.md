<h2>Description</h2><p>Farmer John and Betsy are playing a game with N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 30,000)identical cubes labeled 1 through N. They start with N stacks, each containing a single cube. Farmer John asks Betsy to perform P (1&lt;= P &lt;= 100,000) operation.  There are two types of operations:
</p>moves and counts.
  * In a move operation, Farmer John asks Bessie to move the stack containing cube X on top of the stack containing cube Y.
  * In a count operation, Farmer John asks Bessie to count the  number of cubes on the stack with cube X that are under the cube X and report that value.

Write a program that can verify the results of the game.
<h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer, P
</p>
* Lines 2..P+1: Each of these lines describes a legal operation. Line 2 describes the first operation, etc.  Each line begins with a 'M' for a move operation or a 'C' for a count operation.  For move operations, the line also contains two integers: X and Y.For count operations, the line also contains a single integer: X.

Note that the value for N does not appear in the input file. No move operation will request a move a stack onto itself.
<h2>Output</h2><p>Print the output from each of the count operations in the same order as the input file.
