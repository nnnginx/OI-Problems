<h2>Description</h2><p>Two positive integers are called friends if they consist of the same decimal digits. So 123 and 32331313323213 are friends, but 123 and 22121221 are not.
</p>
Two positive integers (that are not friends) are called almost friends if a single neighbour exchange in one of them results in a pair of friends. A neighbour exchanges two neighbouring digits a and b into a-1 and b+1, or into a+1 and b-1, provided that these new digits are still in the range 0...9, and that no leading zero is generated. So 123 and 2223042 are almost friends(let 04-&gt;13), and 137 and 470 are neither friends nor almost friends(note that 13 -&gt; 04 is not allowd).
The problem is to determine if two given integers are friends or almost friends.<h2>Input</h2><p>The frist line of the input contains a single number: the number of test cases to follow. Each test case has the following format:
</p>One line with two integer x and y, separated by a single space, with 0 &lt; x, y &lt; 10<sup>100</sup><p>.Both integers start with a non-zero digit.
</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For every test case in the input, the output should contain a single line with the string "friends" or "almost friends" or "nothing", reflecting the property of the two given integers
