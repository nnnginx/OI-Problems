<h2>Description</h2><p>For each prefix of a given string S with N characters (each character has an ASCII code between 97 and 126, inclusive), we want to know whether the prefix is a periodic string. That is, for each i (2 &lt;= i &lt;= N) we want to know the largest K &gt; 1 (if there is one) such that the prefix of S with length i can be written as A</p><sup>K</sup><p> ,that is A concatenated K times, for some string A. Of course, we also want to know the period K.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first one contains N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1 000 000) ¨C the size of the string S.The second line contains the string S. The input file ends with a line, having the
</p>number zero on it.<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output "Test case #" and the consecutive test case number on a single line; then, for each prefix with length i that has a period K &gt; 1, output the prefix size i and the period K separated by a single space; the prefix sizes must be in increasing order. Print a blank line after each test case.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
