<h2>Description</h2><p>Farmer John wishes to build a corral for his cows. Being finicky beasts, they demand that the corral be square and that the corral contain at least C (1 &lt;= C &lt;= 500) clover fields for afternoon treats. The corral's edges must be parallel to the X,Y axes. 
</p>
FJ's land contains a total of N (C &lt;= N &lt;= 500) clover fields, each a block of size 1 x 1 and located at with its lower left corner at integer X and Y coordinates each in the range 1..10,000. Sometimes more than one clover field grows at the same location; such a field would have its location appear twice (or more) in the input. A corral surrounds a clover field if the field is entirely located inside the corral's borders.

Help FJ by telling him the side length of the smallest square containing C clover fields.<h2>Input</h2><p>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: C and N
</p>
Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers that are the X,Y coordinates of a clover field.<h2>Output</h2><p>Line 1: A single line with a single integer that is length of one edge of the minimum size square that contains at least C clover fields.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3 4
