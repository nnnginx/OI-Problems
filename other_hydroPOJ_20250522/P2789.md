<h2>Description</h2><img src="images/2789_1.jpg"><p>
</p>Shuffling the pixels in a bitmap image sometimes yields random looking images. However, by repeating the shuffling enough times, one finally recovers the original images. This should be no surprise, since ``shuffling" means applying a one-to-one mapping (or permutation) over the cells of the image, which come in finite number. 
<b>Problem </b><p>
</p>Your program should read a number n , and a series of elementary transformations that define a ``shuffling" ¦Õ of n x n images. Then, your program should compute the minimal number m (m &gt; 0) , such that m applications of ¦Õ always yield the original n x n image. 

For instance if ¦Õ is counter-clockwise 90<sup>o</sup><p> rotation then m = 4 . 
</p><img src="images/2789_2.jpg"><h2>Input</h2><p>Input is made of two lines, the first line is number n ( 2&lt;=n&lt;=2</p><sup>10</sup><p> , n even). The number n is the size of images, one image is represented internally by a n x n pixel matrix (a</p><sup>j</sup><sub>i</sub><p>) , where i is the row number and j is the column number. The pixel at the upper left corner is at row 0 and column 0. 
</p>
The second line is a non-empty list of at most 32 words, separated by spaces. Valid words are the keywords id, rot, sym, bhsym, bvsym, div and mix, or a keyword followed by ``-". Each keyword key designates an elementary transform (as defined by Figure 1), and key- designates the inverse of transform key. For instance, rot- is the inverse of counter-clockwise 90<sup>o</sup><p> rotation, that is clockwise 90</p><sup>o</sup><p> rotation. Finally, the list k1, k2,..., kp designates the compound transform ¦Õ = k</p><sub>1</sub><p>ok</p><sub>2</sub><p>o ... ok</p><sub>p</sub><p> . For instance, ``bvsym rot-" is the transform that first performs clockwise 90</p><sup>o</sup><p> rotation and then vertical symmetry on the lower half of the image.

You may assume that, for all test input, you have m &lt; 2</p><sup>31</sup><p> . </p><pre><code class="language-input1">256
