<h2>Description</h2><p>The table surface is divided into N by M square cells. Some cubes are stacked one upon another over the cells, forming towers. For each cell the number of cubes stacked over it is given in the matrix A.
</p>
Your program must output the view of the table in ASCII graphics, where each cube is represented as shown below:
<pre>  +---+
<br> /   /|      
<br>+---+ |      
<br>|   | + 
<br>|   |/ 
<br>+---+</pre><p>
</p> (here the characters used are '+', '-', '/', '|', their ASCII codes are ASCII 43, 45, 47, 124) 


The dot (ASCII 46) must be used as a background. 

<b>Constraints </b><p>
</p>1 ¡Ü N, M, Aij ¡Ü 50 <h2>Input</h2><p>Input contains integers N M, followed by matrix A, row-by-row. The first row describes the cube tower furthest from the viewer, left to right, and the last row -- nearest to the viewer. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>Output must contain a string representation of the table view, with minimal number of lines required to show all cubes. Each line must contain a string of equal length, which is the minimal width required to show all cubes. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">3 5
