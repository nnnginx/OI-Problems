<h2>Description</h2><p>Consider a pool table with a cue ball and a target ball. The cue ball must bounce off of a certain number of cushions (i.e. edges of the table), and then hit the target ball. What is the minimum distance that the cue ball has to travel?

</p>
Assume ideal cushions (i.e., laws of reflection apply), and a negligible ball diameter. The coordinate system uses a corner of the table as the origin, and the edges of the table are aligned with the coordinate axes. If the cue ball hits in a corner, it is considered to be hitting two cushions. The cue ball must hit exactly the correct number of cushions first, before hitting the target the ball.<h2>Input</h2><p>There will be multiple test cases. Each case is on a single line containing seven integers:
</p><p style="padding-left: 30px">
<br>L W CX CY TX TY N
<br></p><p>
</p>The first two integers, L and W (2 ¡Ü L,W ¡Ü 100), are the dimensions of the table. The next two pairs of integers are the coordinates (X, Y) of the cue and target balls, such that 0 &lt; CX,TX &lt; L, and 0 &lt; CY,TY &lt; W, and (CX,CY) is not the same as (TX,TY). The last integer N, (0 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 100), is the number of cushions that must be hit. The test cases will be followed by a line with seven 0's.<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print a single decimal number, rounded (NOT truncated) to 3 decimal places, representing the shortest distance the cue ball must travel. Print each answer on its own line, with no blank lines between answers.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">20 15 10 1 12 1 1
