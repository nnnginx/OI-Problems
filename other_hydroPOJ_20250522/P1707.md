<h2>Description</h2><p>A young schoolboy would like to calculate the sum

</p>for some fixed natural k and different natural n. He observed that calculating i<sup>k</sup><p> for all i (1&lt;=i&lt;=n) and summing up results is a too slow way to do it, because the number of required arithmetical operations increases as n increases. Fortunately, there is another method which takes only a constant number of operations regardless of n. It is possible to show that the sum S</p><sub>k</sub><p>(n) is equal to some polynomial of degree k+1 in the variable n with rational coefficients, i.e.,

</p>We require that integer M be positive and as small as possible. Under this condition the entire set of such numbers (i.e. M, a<sub>k+1</sub><p>, a</p><sub>k</sub><p>, ... , a</p><sub>1</sub><p>, a</p><sub>0</sub><p>) will be unique for the given k. You have to write a program to find such set of coefficients to help the schoolboy make his calculations quicker.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input file contains a single integer k (1&lt;=k&lt;=20). </p><h2>Output</h2><p>Write integer numbers M, a</p><sub>k+1</sub><p>, a</p><sub>k</sub><p>, ... ,  a</p><sub>1</sub><p>, a</p><sub>0</sub><p> to the output file in the given order. Numbers should be separated by one space. Remember that you should write the answer with the smallest positive M possible.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">2</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">6 2 3 1 0
