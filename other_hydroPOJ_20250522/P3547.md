<h2>Description</h2><p>A square sheet of paper is partitioned into N*M equal squares by horizontal and vertical lines, 2 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 100, 2 ¡Ü M ¡Ü 100, N+M ¡Ý 7. A natural number not exceeding <nobr>20 000</nobr> is written in each square.</p><p>The task is to cut out a connected figure according to the following rules:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;you can cut only along the drawn lines;</li><li>the figure must contain exactly 6 squares;</li><li>the figure must a cube evolvent, i.e. it must be possible to obtain a cube model by folding the figure along the drawn lines;</li><li>the sum of the numbers on the evolvent must be the maximal possible.</li></ul><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line contains two integers N and M separated by one or more spaces. The next N lines contain M integers each. The integers are separated by one or more spaces.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>This unique line contains the sum of the numbers on the found evolvent.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4 4
