<h2>Description</h2><p>Beads of N colors are connected together into a circular necklace of N beads (N&lt;=1000000000). Your job is to calculate how many different kinds of the necklace can be produced. You should know that the necklace might not use up all the N colors, and the repetitions that are produced by rotation around the center of the circular necklace are all neglected. 
</p>
You only need to output the answer module a given number P.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input is an integer X (X &lt;= 3500) representing the number of test cases. The following X lines each contains two numbers N and P (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000000000, 1 &lt;= P &lt;= 30000), representing a test case.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output one line containing the answer.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
