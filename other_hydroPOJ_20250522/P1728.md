<h2>Description</h2><img src="images/1728_1.jpg" align="right"><p>An infinite chessboard is obtained by extending a finite chessboard to the right and up infinitely. Each square of the chessboard is either black or white with the side of S milimiters, 0 &lt; S &lt;= 1000. The leftmost bottom square of the chessboard is black. A flea is positioned on the chessboard at the point (x, y) (given in milimeters) and makes jumps by jumping dx milimeters to the right and dy milimiters up, 0 &lt; dx, dy, that is, a flea at position (x, y) after one jump lands at position (x+dx, y+dy). 
</p>Given the starting position of the flea on the board your task is to find out after how many jumps the flea will reach a white square. If the flea lands on a boundary between two squares then it does not count as landing on the white square. Note that it is possible that the flea never reaches a white square. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>Each test case consists of one line of input containing five non-negative numbers separated by white space and giving integers S, x, y, dx, and dy. An input line containing five zeroes follows the last test case.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For test case print one line of output in the format shown in the sample. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">10 2 3 3 2
