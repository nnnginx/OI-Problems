<h2>Description</h2><p>Nemo is a naughty boy. One day he went into the deep sea all by himself. Unfortunately, he became lost and couldn't find his way home. Therefore, he sent a signal to his father, Marlin, to ask for help.
</p>After checking the map, Marlin found that the sea is like a labyrinth with walls and doors. All the walls are parallel to the X-axis or to the Y-axis. The thickness of the walls are assumed to be zero.
All the doors are opened on the walls and have a length of 1. Marlin cannot go through a wall unless there is a door on the wall. Because going through a door is dangerous (there may be some virulent medusas near the doors), Marlin wants to go through as few doors as he could to find Nemo.
Figure-1 shows an example of the labyrinth and the path Marlin went through to find Nemo.

</p>We assume Marlin's initial position is at (0, 0). Given the position of Nemo and the configuration of walls and doors, please write a program to calculate the minimum number of doors Marlin has to go through in order to reach Nemo.<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case is started by two non-negative integers M and N. M represents the number of walls in the labyrinth and N represents the number of doors. 
</p>Then follow M lines, each containing four integers that describe a wall in the following format: 
x y d t 
(x, y) indicates the lower-left point of the wall, d is the direction of the wall -- 0 means it's parallel to the X-axis and 1 means that it's parallel to the Y-axis, and t gives the length of the wall. 
The coordinates of two ends of any wall will be in the range of [1,199]. 
Then there are N lines that give the description of the doors: 
x y d 
x, y, d have the same meaning as the walls. As the doors have fixed length of 1, t is omitted. 
The last line of each case contains two positive float numbers: 
f1 f2 
(f1, f2) gives the position of Nemo. And it will not lie within any wall or door. 
A test case of M = -1 and N = -1 indicates the end of input, and should not be processed.<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, in a separate line, please output the minimum number of doors Marlin has to go through in order to rescue his son. If he can't reach Nemo, output -1.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">8 9
