<h2>Description</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>J.P. Flathead¡¯s Grocery Store hires cheap labor to man the checkout stations. The people he hires (usually high school kids) often make mistakes making change for the customers. Flathead, who¡¯s a bit of a tightwad, figures he loses more money from these mistakes than he makes; that is, the employees tend to give more change to the customers than they should get. </p><p>Flathead wants you to write a program that calculates the number of quarters ($0.25), dimes ($0.10), nickels ($0.05) and pennies ($0.01) that the customer should get back. Flathead always wants to give the customer¡¯s change in coins if the amount due back is $5.00 or under. He also wants to give the customers back the smallest total number of coins. For example, if the change due back is $1.24, the customer should receive 4 quarters, 2 dimes, 0 nickels, and 4 pennies.</p></span><h2>Input</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The first line of input contains an integer <i><b>N </b></i>which is the number of datasets that follow. Each dataset consists of a single line containing a single integer which is the change due in cents, <i><b>C</b></i>, (1 ¡Ü <b><i>C</i> </b>¡Ü 500).</p></span><h2>Output</h2><p>For each dataset, print out the dataset number, a space, and the string:</p><i><b></b></i><p align="center"><i><b>Q</b></i><b><code> QUARTER(S), </code><i>D</i><code> DIME(S), </code><i>n</i><code> NICKEL(S), </code><i>P</i><code> PENNY(S)</code></b></p><p>Where <i><b>Q</b></i> is he number of quarters, <i><b>D</b></i> is the number of dimes, <i><b>n</b></i> is the number of nickels and <i><b>P</b></i> is the number of pennies.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
