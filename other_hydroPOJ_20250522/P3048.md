<h2>Description</h2><p>To improve the organization of his farm, Farmer John labels each of his N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 5,000) cows with a distinct serial number in the range 1..20,000.  Unfortunately, he is unaware that the cows interpret some serial numbers as better than others.  In particular, a cow whose serial number has the highest prime factor enjoys the highest social standing among all the other cows.
</p>
(Recall that a prime number is just a number that has no divisors except for 1 and itself.  The number 7 is prime while the number 6, being divisible by 2 and 3, is not).

Given a set of N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 5,000) serial numbers in the range 1..20,000, determine the one that has the largest prime factor.<h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer, N
</p>
* Lines 2..N+1: The serial numbers to be tested, one per line<h2>Output</h2><p>* Line 1: The integer with the largest prime factor.  If there are more than one, output the one that appears earliest in the input file.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
