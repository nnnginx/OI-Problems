<h2>Description</h2><p>Count the number of permutations that have a specific number of inversions.
</p>Given a permutation a1, a2, a3,..., an of the n integers 1, 2, 3, ..., n, an inversion is a pair (ai, aj) where i &lt; j and ai &gt; aj. The number of inversions in a permutation gives an indication on how "unsorted" a permutation is. If we wish to analyze the average running time of a sorting algorithm, it is often useful to know how many permutations of n objects will have a certain number of inversions.

In this problem you are asked to compute the number of permutations of n values that have exactly k inversions.

For example, if n = 3, there are 6 permutations with the indicated inversions as follows:
<blockquote><pre>123			0 inversions
<br> 
<br>132			1 inversion (3 &gt; 2)
<br> 
<br>213			1 inversion (2 &gt; 1)
<br> 
<br>231			2 inversions (2 &gt; 1, 3 &gt; 1)
<br> 
<br>312			2 inversions (3 &gt; 1, 3 &gt; 2)
<br> 
<br>321			3 inversions (3 &gt; 2, 3 &gt; 1, 2 &gt; 1)</pre></blockquote><p> 
</p>Therefore, for the permutations of 3 things
<ul><li>1 of them has 0 inversions 
<br></li><li>2 of them have 1 inversion 
<br></li><li>2 of them have 2 inversions 
<br></li><li>1 of them has 3 inversions 
<br></li><li>0 of them have 4 inversions 
<br></li><li>0 of them have 5 inversions 
<br></li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>
</p>
<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists one or more problems. The input for each problem is specified on a single line, giving the integer n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 18) and a non-negative integer k (0 &lt;= k &lt;= 200). The end of input is specified by a line with n = k = 0.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each problem, output the number of permutations of {1, ..., n}with exactly k inversions.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3 0
