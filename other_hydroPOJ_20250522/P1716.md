<h2>Description</h2><p>An integer interval [a,b], a &lt; b, is a set of all consecutive integers beginning with a and ending with b. 
</p>Write a program that: finds the minimal number of elements in a set containing at least two different integers from each interval.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains the number of intervals n, 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10000. Each of the following n lines contains two integers a, b separated by a single space, 0 &lt;= a &lt; b &lt;= 10000. They are the beginning and the end of an interval. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>Output the minimal number of elements in a set containing at least two different integers from each interval. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
