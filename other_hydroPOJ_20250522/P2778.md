<h2>Description</h2><p>It's well known that DNA Sequence is a sequence only contains A, C, T and G, and it's very useful to analyze a segment of DNA Sequence£¬For example, if a animal's DNA sequence contains segment ATC then it may mean that the animal may have a genetic disease. Until now scientists have found several those segments, the problem is how many kinds of DNA sequences of a species don't contain those segments.
</p>
Suppose that DNA sequences of a species is a sequence that consist of A, C, T and G£¬and the length of sequences is a given integer n.
<h2>Input</h2><p>First line contains two integer m (0 &lt;= m &lt;= 10), n (1 &lt;= n &lt;=2000000000). Here, m is the number of genetic disease segment, and n is the length of sequences.
</p>
Next m lines each line contain a DNA genetic disease segment, and length of these segments is not larger than 10.
<h2>Output</h2><p>An integer, the number of DNA sequences, mod 100000.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4 3
