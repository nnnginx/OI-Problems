<h2>Description</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>Johann Carl Friedrich Gauß (1777 – 1855) was one of the most important German mathematicians. For those of you who remember the Deutsche Mark, a picture of him was printed on the 10 – DM bill. In elementary school, his teacher J. G. Büttner tried to occupy the pupils by making them add up the integers from 1 to 100. The young Gauß surprised everybody by producing the correct answers (5050) within seconds.</p><p>Can you write a computer program that can compute such sums really quickly?</p><p>Given two integers <i>n</i> and <i>m</i>, you should compute the sum of all the integers from <i>n</i> to <i>m</i>. In other words, you should compute</p></span><center><img src="images/2924_1.gif"></center><h2>Input</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The first line contains the number of scenarios. Each scenario consists of a line containing the numbers <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> (−10<sup>9</sup> ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ <i>m</i> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).</p></span><p>
</p><h2>Output</h2><span lang="en-us"><p>The output for every scenario begins with a line containing “<tt>Scenario #</tt><i>i</i><tt>:</tt>”, where <i>i</i> is the number of the scenario starting at 1. Then print the sum of all integers from <i>n</i> to <i>m</i>. Terminate the output for the scenario with a blank line.</p></span><pre><code class="language-input1">3
