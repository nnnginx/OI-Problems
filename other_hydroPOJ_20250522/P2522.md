<h2>Description</h2><p>A partition of a positive integer number m into n elements (n &lt;= m) is a sequence of positive numbers a1,...,an such that a1+...+an = m and a1 &lt;= a2 &lt;= ... &lt;= an. Your task is to find a partition of a number m which occupies the k-th position in the lexicographically ordered sequence of all partitions of m into n elements. 
</p>The lexicographic ordering among the partitions of a number is defined as follows. For two partitions a and b of m into n elements such that a = [a1,...,an] and b = [b1,...,bn] we have a  &lt;  b if and only if there exists an 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n such that for all j &lt; i we have aj = bj and ai &lt; bi. The sequence of all partitions is ordered in increasing lexicographic order and at the first we have the following sequence 1, 1, ... 1, m-n+1. <h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains a number c giving the number of cases that follow. Each of the subsequent c lines contains three numbers: 1 &lt;= m &lt;= 220, 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10 and 1 &lt;= k which is not bigger than the number of partitions of m into n elements. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each input data set print the k-th partition of m into n elements. Each element of a partition is to be printed in a separate line. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">2
