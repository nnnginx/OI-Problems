<h2>Description</h2><p>Starting from point (0,0) on a plane, we have written all non-negative integers 0,1,2, ... as shown in the figure. For example, 1, 2, and 3 has been written at points (1,1), (2,0), and (3, 1) respectively and this pattern has continued.

</p>You are to write a program that reads the coordinates of a point (x, y), and writes the number (if any) that has been written at that point. (x, y) coordinates in the input are in the range 0...5000.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input is N, the number of test cases for this problem. In each of the N following lines, there is x, and y representing the coordinates (x, y) of a point.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each point in the input, write the number written at that point or write No Number if there is none.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
