<h2>Description</h2><p>For this problem, you will write a program that takes a (possibly long) string of decimal digits, and outputs the permutation of those decimal digits that has the next larger value (as a decimal number) than the input number.  For example: 
</p> 
123 -&gt; 132 
279134399742 -&gt; 279134423799 
 
It is possible that no permutation of the input digits has a larger value.  For example, 987. <h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ¡Ü P ¡Ü 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow.  Each data set is a single line that contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by up to 80 decimal digits which is the input value.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each data set there is one line of output.  If there is no larger permutation of the input digits, the output should be the data set number followed by a single space, followed by the string BIGGEST.  If there is a solution, the output should be the data set number, a single space and the next larger permutation of the input digits.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3
