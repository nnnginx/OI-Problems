For example, number 1334 contains three different digits 1, 3 and 4.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of no more than 50 test cases. Each test case has only one line, which contains a positive integer n ( 1&lt;=n &lt; 65536). There are no blank lines between cases. A line with a single `0' terminates the input. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, you should output one line, which contains m.
