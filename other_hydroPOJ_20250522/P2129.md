<h2>Description</h2><p>Consider a real polynomial P (x, y) in two variables. It is called invariant with respect to the rotation 
</p>by an angle ¦Á if 
<center>P (x cos ¦Á - y sin ¦Á, x sin ¦Á + y cos ¦Á) = P (x, y) </center><p>
</p>for all real x and y. 
Let's consider the real vector space formed by all polynomials in two variables of degree not greater than d invariant with respect to the rotation by 2¦Ð/n. Your task is to calculate the dimension of this vector space. 
You might find useful the following remark: Any polynomial of degree not greater than d can be uniquely written in form 
<center><font size="5">P (x, y) = ¦²<sub>i,j&gt;=0,i+j&lt;=d</sub>a<sub>ij</sub>x<sup>i</sup>y<sup>j</sup> </font></center><p>
</p>for some real coefficients a<sub>ij</sub><p> . </p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains two positive integers d and n separated by one space. It is guaranteed that they are less than one thousand. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>Output a single integer M which is the dimension of the vector space described. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">2 2</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">4</code></pre><h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=Northeastern+Europe+2003">Northeastern Europe 2003</a><p>, Northern Subregion</p>
