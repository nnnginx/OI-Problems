<h2>Description</h2><p>Frank is a professional stock trader for Advanced Commercial Markets Limited (ACM Ltd). He likes "easy trading" -- using a straightforward strategy to decide when to buy stock and when to sell it. Frank has a database of historical stock prices for each day. He uses two integer numbers m and n (1 &lt;= m &lt; n &lt;= 100) as parameters of his trading strategy. Every day he computes two numbers: P(m) -- an average stock price for the previous m days, and P(n) ¡ª an average stock price for the previous n days. P(m) &gt; P(n) is an indicator of the upward trend (traders call it bullish trend), and P(m) &lt; P(n) is an indicator of the downward trend (traders call it bearish trend). In practice the values for P(m) and P(n) are never equal.
</p>When a trend reverses from bearish to bullish it is a signal for Frank to buy stock. When a trend reverses from bullish to bearish it is a signal to sell.

</p>Frank has different values for m and n in mind and he wants to backtest them using historical prices. He takes a set of k (n &lt; k &lt;= 10 000) historical prices pi (0 &lt; pi &lt; 100 for 1 &lt;= i &lt;= k). For each i (n &lt;= i &lt;= k) he computes Pi(m) and Pi(n) ¡ª an arithmetic average of p<sub>i-m+1</sub><p> . . . p</p><sub>i</sub><p> and p</p><sub>i-n+1</sub><p> . . . p</p><sub>i</sub><p> respectively. Backtesting generates trading signals according to the following rules.
</p><ul><li>If Pi(m) &gt; Pi(n) there is a bullish trend for day i and a "BUY ON DAY i" signal is generated if i = n or there was a bearish trend on day i - 1.
<br></li><li>If Pi(m) &lt; Pi(n) there is a bearish tread for day i and a "SELL ON DAY i" signal is generated if i = n or there was a bullish trend on day i - 1. </li></ul><p>
</p>Your task is to write a program that backtests a specified strategy for Frank -- you shall print a signal for the first tested day (day n) followed by the signals in increasing day numbers.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains three integer numbers m, n, and k. It is followed by k lines with stock prices for days 1 to k. Each stock price pi is specified with two digits after decimal point. Prices in the input file are such that Pi(m) != Pi(n) for all i (n &lt;= i &lt;= k).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Write to the output a list of signals -- one signal on a line, as described in the problem statement.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">3 5 17
