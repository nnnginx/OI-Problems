<h2>Description</h2><p>Transmitting and memorizing information is a task that requires different coding systems for the best use of the available space. A well known system is that one where a number is associated to a character sequence. It is considered that the words are made only of small characters of the English alphabet a,b,c, ..., z (26 characters). From all these words we consider only those whose letters are in lexigraphical order (each character is smaller than the next character).
</p>
The coding system works like this: 
•	The words are arranged in the increasing order of their length.
•	The words with the same length are arranged in lexicographical order (the order from the dictionary). 
•	We codify these words by their numbering, starting with a, as follows:
a 	- 1   
b 	- 2
...
z 	- 26
ab 	- 27
...
az 	- 51
bc 	- 52
...
vwxyz 	- 83681
...

Specify for a given word if it can be codified according to this coding system. For the affirmative case specify its code. 
<h2>Input</h2><p>The only line contains a word. There are some constraints:
</p>•	The word is maximum 10 letters length
•	The English alphabet has 26 characters.
<h2>Output</h2><p>The output will contain the code of the given word, or 0 if the word can not be codified. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">bf</code></pre><pre><code class="language-output1">55</code></pre><h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=Romania+OI+2002">Romania OI 2002</a>
