<h2>Description</h2><img src="images/2640_1.jpg" align="right"><p>George has K &lt;= 20 steel wires shaped in the form of half-circles, with radii a1, a2, . . . , aK. They can be soldered (connected) at the ends, in any angle. Is it possible for George to make a closed shape out of these wires? He does not have to use all the wires.
</p>The wires can be combined at any angle, but may not intersect. Beware of floating point errors.<h2>Input</h2><p>Each data set consists of a number 0 &lt; K &lt;= 20 on a line by itself, followed by a line of K space-separated numbers ai. Each number is in the range 0 &lt; ai &lt; 10</p><sup>7</sup><p>, and has at most 3 digits after the decimal point. 
</p>The input will be terminated by a zero on a line by itself.<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, there should be one word on a line by itself; "YES" if it is possible to make a simple connected figure out of the given arcs, and "NO" if it isn¡¯t.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
