<h2>Description</h2><p>A bar-code symbol consists of alternating dark and light bars, starting with a dark bar on the left. Each bar is a number of units wide. Figure 1 shows a bar-code symbol consisting of 4 bars that extend over 1+2+3+1=7 units.

In general, the bar code BC(n,k,m) is the set of all symbols with k bars that together extend over exactly n units, each bar being at most m units wide. For instance, the symbol in Figure 1 belongs to BC(7,4,3) but not to BC(7,4,2).

Figure 2 shows all 16 symbols in BC(7,4,3). Each `1' represents a dark unit, each `0' a light unit. The symbols appear in lexicographic (dictionary) order. The number on the left of the colon (`:') is the rank of the symbol. The symbol in Figure 1 has rank 4 in BC(7,4,3). 
<h2>Input</h2><p>Your program is to read from standard input. The first line contains the numbers n, k, and m (1 &lt;= n,k,m &lt;= 33). On the second line is a number s (0 &lt;= s &lt;= 100). The following s lines each contain some symbol in BC(n,k,m), represented by '0's and '1's as in Figure 2. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>Your program is to write to standard output. On the first line your program should write the total number of symbols in BC(n,k,m). On each of the s following lines, it should write the rank of the corresponding symbol in the input.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">7 4 3
