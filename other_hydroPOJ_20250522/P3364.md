<h2>Description</h2><p>You are visiting the Centre Pompidou which contains a lot of modern paintings. In particular you notice one painting which consists solely of black and white squares, arranged in rows and columns like in a chess board (no two adjacent squares have the same colour). By the way, the artist did not use the tool of problem A to create the painting.</p><p>Since you are bored, you wonder how many <i>8 ¡Á 8</i> chess boards are embedded within this painting. The bottom right corner of a chess board must always be white.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of one line with three integers <strong>n</strong>, <strong>m</strong> and <strong>c</strong>. (<i>8 ¡Ü n, m ¡Ü 40000</i>), where <strong>n</strong> is the number of rows of the painting, and <strong>m</strong> is the number of columns of the painting. <strong>c</strong> is always <i>0</i> or <i>1</i>, where <i>0</i> indicates that the bottom right corner of the painting is black, and <i>1</i> indicates that this corner is white.</p><p>The last test case is followed by a line containing three zeros.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print the number of chess boards embedded within the given painting.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">8 8 0
