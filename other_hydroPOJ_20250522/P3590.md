<h2>Description</h2><div><p>Any case of shuffling of n cards can be described with a permutation of 1 to n. Thus there are totally <i>n</i>! cases of shuffling. Now suppose there are 5 cards, and a case of shuffle is &lt;5, 3, 2, 1, 4&gt;, then the shuffle will be:</p><p>Before shuffling£º1, 2, 3, 4, 5<br>The 1st shuffle£º5, 3, 2, 1, 4<br>The 2nd shuffle£º4, 2, 3, 5, 1<br>The 3rd shuffle£º1, 3, 2, 4, 5<br>The 4th shuffle£º5, 2, 3, 1, 4<br>The 5th shuffle£º4, 3, 2, 5, 1<br>The 6th shuffle£º1, 2, 3, 4, 5(the same as it is in the beginning)</p><p>You'll find that after six shuffles, the cards' order returns the beginning. In fact, there is always a number <i>m</i> for any case of shuffling that the cards' order returns the beginning after <i>m</i> shuffles. Now your task is to find the shuffle with the largest <i>m</i>. If there is not only one, sort out the one with the smallest order.</p></div><h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input is an integer <i>T</i> which indicates the number of test cases. Each test case occupies a line, contains an integer <i>n</i> (1 ¡Ü <i>n</i> ¡Ü 100).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Each test case takes a line, with an integer <i>m</i> in the head, following the case of shuffling.<br>¡¡</p><pre><code class="language-input1">2
