<h2>Description</h2><p>A game-board consists of N fields placed around a circle. Fields are successively numbered from1 to N clockwise. In some fields there may be obstacles.
</p>
Player starts on a field marked with number 1. His goal is to reach a given field marked with number Z. The only way of moving is a clockwise jump of length K. The only restriction is that the fields the player may jump to should not contain any obstacle.

For example, if N = 13, K = 3 and Z = 9, the player can jump across the fields 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 3, 6 and 9, reaching his goal under condition that none of these fields is occupied by an obstacle.

Your task is to write a program that finds the smallest possible number K.
<h2>Input</h2><p>First line of the input consists of integers N, Z and M, 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000, 2 &lt;= Z &lt;= N, 0 &lt;= M &lt;= N - 2. N represents number of fields on the game-board and Z is a given goal-field.
</p>
Next line consists of M different integers that represent marks of fields having an obstacle. It is confirmed that fields marked 1 and Z do not contain an obstacle.<h2>Output</h2><p>Output a line contains the requested number K described above.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">9 7 2
