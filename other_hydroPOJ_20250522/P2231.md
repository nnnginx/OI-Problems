<h2>Description</h2><p>Farmer John has received a noise complaint from his neighbor, Farmer Bob, stating that his cows are making too much noise.
</p>
FJ's N cows (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10,000) all graze at various locations on a long one-dimensional pasture.  The cows are very chatty animals. Every pair of cows simultaneously carries on a conversation (so every cow is simultaneously MOOing at all of the N-1 other cows). When cow i MOOs at cow j, the volume of this MOO must be equal to the distance between i and j, in order for j to be able to hear the MOO at all.  Please help FJ compute the total volume of sound being generated by all N*(N-1) simultaneous MOOing sessions.<h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: N

There are five cows at locations 1, 5, 3, 2, and 4.

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Cow at 1 contributes 1+2+3+4=10, cow at 5 contributes 4+3+2+1=10, cow at 3 contributes 2+1+1+2=6, cow at 2 contributes 1+1+2+3=7, and cow at 4 contributes 3+2+1+1=7.  The total volume is (10+10+6+7+7) = 40.<h2>Source</h2><a href="searchproblem?field=source&amp;key=USACO+2005+January+Silver">USACO 2005 January Silver</a>
