<h2>Description</h2><p>A polycube is a solid made by gluing together unit cubes (one unit on each edge) on one or more faces.  The figure in the lower-left is not a polycube because some cubes are attached along an edge.

For this problem, the polycube will be formed from unit cubes centered at integer lattice points in 3-space.  The polycube will be built up one cube at a time, starting with a cube centered at (0,0,0).  At each step of the process (after the first cube), the next cube must have a face in common with a cube previously included and not be the same as a block previously included.  For example, a 1-by-1-by-5 block (as shown above in the upper-left polycube) could be built up as: 
 
(0,0,0) (0,0,1) (0,0,2) (0,0,3) (0,0,4) 
 
and a 2-by-2-by-2 cube (upper-right figure) could be built as: 
 
(0,0,0) (0,0,1) (0,1,1) (0,1,0) (1,0,0) (1,0,1) (1,1,1) (1,1,0)

Since the surface of the polycube is made up of unit squares, its area is an integer. 
 
Write a program which takes as input a sequence of integer lattice points in 3-space and determines whether is correctly forms a polycube and, if so, what the surface area of the polycube is.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000) which is the number of data sets that follow.  Each data set consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains the number of points P, (1 &lt;= P &lt;= 100) in the problem instance.  Each succeeding line contains the centers of the cubes, eight to a line (except possibly for the last line).  Each center is given as 3 integers, separated by commas.  The points are separated by a single space.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each data set, you should generate one line of output with the following values:  The data set number as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space and the surface area of the polycube if it is correctly formed, OR, if it is not correctly formed, the string ¡°NO¡± a space and the index (starting with 1) of the  first cube which does not share a face with a previous cube.  Note that the surface area includes the area of any included holes.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">4
