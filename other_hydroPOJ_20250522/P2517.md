<h2>Description</h2><p>Given an N * N matrix A, whose elements are positive integers and not larger than 10000. There are also some '*'s in matrix A. Your program must find such three (perhaps overlapping) rectangles that they would contain all the '*'s which are in matrix A and the areas of these three rectangles (the area of one rectangle define as the number of elements it covers) must be non-negative and not exceed a given integer M.
</p>
If several solutions exist, the program should find a solution with minimal total costs of these three rectangles. The cost of one rectangle defines as the sum of all the numbers it contains in matrix A.<h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input is an integer X representing the number of test cases. The following X blocks each represents a test case.
</p>
The first line of each block contains two numbers N and M (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 30, 0 &lt;= M &lt;= N * N) representing the size of the matrix and the maximum area of each rectangle. The second line contains a number C (0 &lt;= C &lt;= N * N), representing the number of '*'s in matrix A. The following C lines each contains two numbers X and Y (1 &lt;= X, Y &lt;= N), representing A[X][Y] (A[X][Y] represents the element in the X-th row and Y-th column)contains a '*'. The following N lines each contains N numbers, representing the matrix A.
<h2>Output</h2><p>For each block output one line, which contains an integer representing the minimum total costs, or 'Impossible' (without quote) if no solution exists.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
