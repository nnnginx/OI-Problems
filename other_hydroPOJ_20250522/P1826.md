<h2>Description</h2><b>Background</b><p>
</p>In a fight against invaders, farmer William get the farmers all around the country together to help the king beat the invaders. So the king decided to award farmer William a great farm after the winning of the war.
<b>Problem</b><p>
</p>The king divides his country as a A*B grid and labels each 1*1 square with a pair of integers. Refer to the following picture as example:

</p>Nevertheless, not all the squares are available. Some have been awarded to others, and some have been destroyed in the war. So the king only list the available 1*1 squares, and let farm William choose some from them. Meanwhile, William can¡¯t choose all of the squares. He can only choose some of them, so that the squares can form a connected area, to build up his farm. A connected area is defined as following:
1.	A connected area is made up of some 1*1 squares;
2.	From any of these 1*1 squares, one can walk to any other 1*1 square belonged to this area without entering some square that is not in this area;
3.	When standing in a square, one can walk into the adjacent squares in four directions: north, south, east, and west.
In addition, every square available has a value. William should choose to build up a farm (connected area) that is the most valuable. In other words, William should choose some of the square forming a connected area, in which the sum of the value of squares is the largest.
Your task in this problem is to find out the largest value.
<h2>Input</h2><p>The input consists of several test cases. In the first line of each test case, there are one positive integers N (1&lt;=N&lt;=200000), indicating the number of available squares. The following N lines contain the information of the N squares, one per line. In one line, there are three integers x y v separated by one blank. (x, y) is the location of this square, and v is its value. All the x and y lie in the range of signed 16-bit integer. The value v is a nonnegative integer that is less than 10000. The test case starting with one zero is the final test case and has no output.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, print your answer, the largest value with which William can build up his farm, in one line without any redundant spaces.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">1
