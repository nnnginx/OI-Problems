<h2>Description</h2><p>Eric has a classic football that is made of 32 pieces of leather: 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons. Each pentagon adjoins 5 hexagons and each hexagon adjoins 3 pentagons and 3 hexagons. Eric drew a polygon (i.e. a closed line without intersections) along the edges of the pieces. The polygon divided the ball into two parts and Eric painted one of them green.

</p>He is curious if given a description of the polygon you are able to compute the number of black, white and green pieces? 

Task
Write a program that:

reads the description of a polygon, 
computes the number of black, white and green pieces, 
writes the result. <h2>Input</h2><p>The first line of the input contains one integer n being the number of vertices of the polygon. The second line of the input contains n integers a1, a2,..., an separated by single spaces. Integer ai (equal 1 or 2) is the number of green pieces adjoining the i-th vertex of the polygon. The side of the polygon connecting the n-th and the first vertex always lies between two hexagons. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>The first and only line of the output contains three integers b, w and g - the numbers of black, white and green pieces respectively. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">21
