<h2>Description</h2><p>Cows like to build shapes out of hay bales. Each new shape is constructed from N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 25,000) 1 x 1 x 1 cubic bales.
</p>
Bale 1 lies on the floor. After placing it, each successive bale from 2 through N is attached to the shape by placing the new bale in the proper relative position to one of the bales already placed.  For instance, imagine the following figure:
<blockquote>     Bale 1 - on the floor
<br>     Bale 2 - RIGHT Bale 1 (to Bale 1's right)
<br>     Bale 3 - FRONT Bale 2 (in front of Bale 2) 
<br>     Bale 4 - FRONT Bale 3</blockquote><p>
</p>This results in an (inverted) L-shape:
<pre><br>                     +--+--+                      
<br>                1-&gt; /  /  /| &lt;-2                      
<br>                   +--+--+ +
<br>                   | /  /|/                         
<br>                   ++--+ +                       
<br>                   /  /|/ &lt;-3                     
<br>                  +--+ +                          
<br>                  |  |/ &lt;-4                       
<br>                  +--+                            </pre><p>
</p>Adding another bale:
<blockquote>Bale 5 - OVER Bale 1</blockquote><p>
</p>adds height to the shape:
<pre><br>                     +--+                            
<br>                    /  /|                           
<br>                   +--+ +--+                      
<br>               5-&gt; |  |/  /| &lt;-2                      
<br>                   +--+--+ +
<br>               1-&gt; | /  /|/                         
<br>                   ++--+ +                       
<br>                   /  /|/ &lt;-3                     
<br>                  +--+ +                          
<br>                  |  |/ &lt;-4                       
<br>                  +--+                            </pre><p>
</p>But adding another directive:
<blockquote>Bale 6 - BACK Bale 4</blockquote><p>
</p>results in an invalid shape, since bales 3 and 6 would overlap.

Given N bales and placements described as above, output the exposed surface area of the solid figure if the shape is valid.  A face is considered exposed if it is not touched by any face of any other bale and does not touch the floor (i.e., is not the bottom of a cube on the floor).  Output -1 if the shape is invalid.  No bale will be placed farther than 25 bale-widths from the first bale.  No bale will be placed below the floor level.

<h2>Input</h2><p>* Line 1: A single integer, N
</p>
* Lines 2..N: These lines describe the placement of bales 2..N in the form "j X". Line 2 describes bale 2; line 3 describes bale 3; and so on. The letter "X" is one of: "L" (left), "R" (right), "F" (front), "B" (back), "O" (over), or "U" (under). The bales can be glued and require no underlying support if extended over an empty space.
<h2>Output</h2><p>* Line 1: The exposed surface area of the resulting solid.  If the solid is invalid, output "-1".
