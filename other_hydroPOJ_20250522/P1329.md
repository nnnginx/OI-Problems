<h2>Description</h2><p>Your team is to write a program that, given the Cartesian coordinates of three points on a plane, will find the equation of the circle through them all. The three points will not be on a straight line. 
</p>The solution is to be printed as an equation of the form 
<pre>	(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2				(1)</pre><p>
</p>and an equation of the form 
<pre>	x^2 + y^2 + cx + dy - e = 0				(2)</pre><p>
</p><h2>Input</h2><p>Each line of input to your program will contain the x and y coordinates of three points, in the order Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy. These coordinates will be real numbers separated from each other by one or more spaces.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Your program must print the required equations on two lines using the format given in the sample below. Your computed values for h, k, r, c, d, and e in Equations 1 and 2 above are to be printed with three digits after the decimal point. Plus and minus signs in the equations should be changed as needed to avoid multiple signs before a number. Plus, minus, and equal signs must be separated from the adjacent characters by a single space on each side. No other spaces are to appear in the equations. Print a single blank line after each equation pair.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">7.0 -5.0 -1.0 1.0 0.0 -6.0
