<h2>Description</h2><p>Soundex coding groups together words that appear to sound alike based on their spelling. For example, "can" and "khawn", "con" and "gone" would be equivalent under Soundex coding. 
</p>Soundex coding involves translating each word into a series of digits in which each digit represents a letter: 
<pre>      1 represents B, F, P, or V
<br>      2 represents C, G, J, K, Q, S, X,  or Z
<br>      3 represents D or T
<br>      4 represents L
<br>      5 represents M or N
<br>      6 represents R</pre><p>
</p>The letters A, E, I, O, U, H, W, and Y are not represented in Soundex coding, and repeated letters with the same code digit are represented by a single instance of that digit. Words with the same Soundex coding are considered equivalent.<h2>Input</h2><p>Each line of input contains a single word, all upper case, less than 20 letters long.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each line of input, produce a line of output giving the Soundex code.
