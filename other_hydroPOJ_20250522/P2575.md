<h2>Description</h2><p>A sequence of n &gt; 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the difference between successive elements take on all the values 1 through n-1. For instance, 
</p>
1 4 2 3

is a jolly jumper, because the absolutes differences are 3, 2, and 1 respectively. The definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. You are to write a program to determine whether or not each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper. <h2>Input</h2><p>Each line of input contains an integer n &lt; 3000 followed by n integers representing the sequence.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each line of input, generate a line of output saying "Jolly" or "Not jolly".
