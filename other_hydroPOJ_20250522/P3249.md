<h2>Description</h2><p>Mr.Dog was fired by his company. In order to support his family, he must find a new job as soon as possible. Nowadays, It's hard to have a job, since there are swelling numbers of the unemployed. So some companies often use hard tests for their recruitment. </p><p>The test is like this: starting from a source-city, you may pass through some directed roads to reach another city. Each time you reach a city, you can earn some profit or pay some fee, Let this process continue until you reach a target-city. The boss will compute the expense you spent for your trip and the profit you have just obtained. Finally, he will decide whether you can be hired. </p><p>In order to get the job, Mr.Dog managed to obtain the knowledge of the net profit <i>V<sub>i</sub></i> of all cities he may reach (a negative <i>V<sub>i</sub></i> indicates that money is spent rather than gained) and the connection between cities. A city with no roads leading to it is a source-city and a city with no roads leading to other cities is a target-city. The mission of Mr.Dog is to start from a source-city and choose a route leading to a target-city through which he can get the maximum profit.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>The input file includes several test cases.
</p>The first line of each test case contains 2 integers <i>n</i><p> and </p><i>m</i><p>(1 ¡Ü </p><i>n</i><p> ¡Ü 100000, 0 ¡Ü </p><i>m</i><p> ¡Ü 1000000) indicating the number of cities and roads.
</p>The next <i>n</i><p> lines each contain a single integer. The </p><i>i</i><p>th line describes the net profit of the city </p><i>i</i><p>, </p><i>V<sub>i</sub></i><p> (0 ¡Ü |</p><i>V<sub>i</sub></i><p>| ¡Ü 20000)
</p>The next m lines each contain two integers <i>x</i><p>, </p><i>y</i><p> indicating that there is a road leads from city </p><i>x</i><p> to city </p><i>y</i><p>. It is guaranteed that each road appears exactly once, and there is no way to return to a previous city.
</p><h2>Output</h2><p>The output file contains one line for each test cases, in which contains an integer indicating the maximum profit Dog is able to obtain (or the minimum expenditure to spend)</p><pre><code class="language-input1">6 5
