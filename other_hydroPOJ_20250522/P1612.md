<h2>Description</h2><p>Let G = (V,E) be a connected graph without loops and multiple edges, where V and E are the vertex and edge, respectively, sets of G. For any two vertices u, v ¡Ê V ,the distance between vertices u and v in G is the number of edges in a shortest u-v path. A shortest path between u and v is called a u-v geodesic. Let I(u, v) denote the set of vertices such that a vertex is in I(u, v) if and only if it is in some u-v geodesic of G and, for a set S &lt;= V , I(S) = </p><font size="5">¡È</font><sub>u,v¡ÊS</sub><p>I(u, v). A vertex set D in graph G is called a geodetic set if I(D) = V . The geodetic set problem is to verify whether D is a geodetic set or not. We use Figure 3 as an example. In Figure 3, I(2, 5) = {2, 3, 4, 5} since there are two shortest paths between vertices 2 and 5. We can see that vertices 3 and 4 are lying on one of these two shortest paths respectively. However, I(2, 5) is not a geodetic set since I(2, 5) != V . Vertex set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is intuitively a geodetic set of G. Vertex set D = {1, 2, 5} is also a geodetic set of G since vertex 3 (respectively,vertex 4) is in the shortest path between vertices 1 and 5 (respectively, vertices 2 and 5). Thus, I(D) = V . Besides, vertex sets {1, 3, 4} and {1, 4, 5} are also geodetic sets.
</p>However, D = {3, 4, 5} is not a geodetic set since vertex 1 is not in I(D).<h2>Input</h2><p>The input file consists of a given graph and several test cases. The first line contains an integer n indicating the number of vertices in the given graph,where 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 40. The vertices of a graph are labeled from 1 to n. Each vertex has a distinct label. The following n lines represent the adjacent vertices of vertex i, i = 1, 2, ... , n. For example, the second line of the sample input indicates that vertex 1 is adjacent with vertices 2 and 3. Note that any two integers in each line are separated by at least one space. After these n lines, there is a line which contains the

</p>number of test cases. Each test case is shown in one line and represents a given subset D of vertices. You have to determine whether D is a geodetic set or not.
<h2>Output</h2><p>For each test case, output 'yes' in one line if it is a geodetic set or 'no' otherwise.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
