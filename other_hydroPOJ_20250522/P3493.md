For each pair of grids subjected to following restraints:</p><ol><li>they are neighbor, in detail, sharing common edge;</li><li>they are colored differently.</li></ol><p>add the product of the two specified integers to the score. And your goal is to maximum the total score. Could you write a program to tell John the maximum score?</p></div><h2>Input</h2><p>The input describes one puzzle which begins with two integer <i>n</i>,<i> m</i>(1 ¡Ü<i> n</i>,<i> m </i>¡Ü16). Then <i>n</i> lines follow. Each contains <i>m</i> integers. The <i>j</i>-th number on <i>i</i>-th row corresponds to the grid(<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>). The absolute value of each number is less than 1000.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>Print the maximum score in a line. ¡¡</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5 5
