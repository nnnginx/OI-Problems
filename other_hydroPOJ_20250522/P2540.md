<h2>Description</h2><p>The children's game Hotter Colder is played as follows. Player A leaves the room while player B hides an object somewhere in the room. Player A re-enters at position (0,0) and then visits various other positions about the room. When player A visits a new position, player B announces "Hotter" if this position is closer to the object than the previous position; player B announces "Colder" if it is farther and "Same" if it is the same distance.</p><h2>Input</h2><p>Input consists of up to 50 lines, each containing an x,y coordinate pair followed by "Hotter", "Colder", or "Same". Each pair represents a position within the room, which may be assumed to be a square with opposite corners at (0,0) and (10,10).</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each line of input print a line giving the total area of the region in which the object may have been placed, to 2 decimal places. If there is no such region, output 0.00. </p><pre><code class="language-input1">10.0 10.0 Colder
