<h2>Description</h2><img src="images/2299_1.jpg" align="right"><p>In this problem, you have to analyze a particular sorting algorithm. The algorithm processes a sequence of n distinct integers by swapping two adjacent sequence elements until the sequence is sorted in ascending order. For the input sequence 
</p><center>9 1 0 5 4 , </center><p>
</p>Ultra-QuickSort produces the output 
<center>0 1 4 5 9 . </center><p>
</p>Your task is to determine how many swap operations Ultra-QuickSort needs to perform in order to sort a given input sequence. <h2>Input</h2><p>The input contains several test cases. Every test case begins with a line that contains a single integer n &lt; 500,000 -- the length of the input sequence. Each of the the following n lines contains a single integer 0 ¡Ü a[i] ¡Ü 999,999,999, the i-th input sequence element. Input is terminated by a sequence of length n = 0. This sequence must not be processed.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>For every input sequence, your program prints a single line containing an integer number op, the minimum number of swap operations necessary to sort the given input sequence.</p><pre><code class="language-input1">5
