<h2>Description</h2><p>Here is game played by little guys. There is a 4 * 4 square, and the square is filled with the characters 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'. Each kind of character appears exactly 4 times. You can arbitrarily swap two adjacent characters (horizontal or vertical). At the beginning of the game you should choose a character (from 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D') as you target character, when any 2 * 2 sub-square contains the same character as the character you have chosen before, you win the game.
</p>
These little guys want to use minimal times of swap to win the game. Now they turn to you. Can you help them?<h2>Input</h2><p>There are multiple test cases. Each contains a 4 * 4 square as the initial situation. Notice that the square only contains 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D', and each kind of characters will appear exactly 4 times.</p><h2>Output</h2><p>You should output the minimal swap times to win the game, and you should also output how many kinds of strategies you can achieve the minimal swap times. 
</p>
You should pay attention that if two strategies swap the characters in the same order but with the different target characters, these two strategies are still considered as different.<pre><code class="language-input1">AABB
