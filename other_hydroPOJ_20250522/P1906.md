<h2>Description</h2><p>Consider the set of all non-negative integer powers of 3. 
</p><center>S = { 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ... } </center><p>
</p>Consider the sequence of all subsets of S ordered by the value of the sum of their elements. The question is simple: find the set at the n-th position in the sequence and print it in increasing order of its elements. <h2>Input</h2><p>Each line of input contains a number n, which is a positive integer with no more than 19 digits. The last line of input contains 0 and it should not be processed. </p><h2>Output</h2><p>For each line of input, output a single line displaying the n-th set as described above, in the format used in the sample output.
