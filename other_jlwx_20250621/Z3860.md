<div>
 Teacher Mai has solved the #P complete in polynomial time recently.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 So he gives this task to you. You are given a matrix of n rows and n columns, you should calculate the permanent of this.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 But this matrix is special, nearly all the elements are 1. Only the cells on the main diagonal are modified.
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 You are given n integers ai. You should calculate permanents of m matrices. The size of i-th matrix is n+i-1.
</div>

## 输入格式

<div>
 There are multiple test cases, terminated by a line "0 0".
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 For each test case, the first line contains two integers n,m(1<=n,m<=10^5).
</div> 
<div></div> 
<div>
 The following one line contains n integers ai,(0<=ai<=10^6).
</div> 
<p></p>

## 输出格式

<div>
 For each test case, first output one line "Case #k:", where k is the case number counting from 1.
</div> 
<div> 
 <div></div> 
 <div>
  The following k lines contains a integer, indicating the permanent of the i-th matrix.
