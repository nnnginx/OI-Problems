<div>
 he cow lineup has a large increasing subsequence of cows by height.To recall, a subsequence is a sub

<div>
 set a(i1),a(i2),…,a(ik)) of elements from the cow sequence, found at some series of indices i1<i2<

<div>
 …<ik, We say the subsequence is increasing if a(i1)≤a(i2)≤…≤a(ik).FJ would like there to be a l

 For example, if we had the list

## 输入格式

<div>
 The first line of input contains N. The remaining N lines contain a(1)…a(N),

<div>
 each an integer in the range 1…50.

## 输出格式

<div>
 Output the number of elements that can possibly form a longest increasing subsequence 
</div>
<div>
 after reversing the contents of at most one subsequence.
