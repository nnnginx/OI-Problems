<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman">To meet the ever-growing demands of his N (1 <= N <= 50,000) cows, <br> Farmer John has bought them a new soda machine. He wants to figure <br> out the perfect place to install the machine. <br> <br> The field in which the cows graze can be represented as a one-dimensional <br> number line. Cow i grazes in the range A_i..B_i (1 <= A_i <= B_i; <br> A_i <= B_i <= 1,000,000,000) (a range that includes its endpoints), <br> and FJ can place the soda machine at any integer point in the range <br> 1..1,000,000,000. Since cows are extremely lazy and try to move <br> as little as possible, each cow would like to have the soda machine <br> installed within her grazing range. <br> <br> Sadly, it is not always possible to satisfy every cow's desires. <br> Thus FJ would like to know the largest number of cows that can be <br> satisfied. <br> <br> To demonstrate the issue, consider four cows with grazing ranges <br> 3..5, 4..8, 1..2, and 5..10; below is a schematic of their grazing <br> ranges: <br> </font></font></p><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <pre><span style="font-size: medium"><br>         1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13

Thus, a maximum of <br> 3 cows can have the soda machine within their grazing range. <br> 有N个人要去膜拜JZ，他们不知道JZ会出现在哪里，因此每个人有一个活动范围，只要JZ出现在这个范围内就能被膜拜， <br> 伟大的JZ当然希望膜拜他的人越多越好，但是JZ不能分身，因此只能选择一个位置出现，他最多可以被多少人膜拜呢， <br> 这个简单的问题JZ当然交给你了 <br> <br> <br> </p> </font></span>
