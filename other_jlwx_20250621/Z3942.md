## 题目描述

<p style="font-family: Raleway, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Farmer John has purchased a subscription to Good Hooveskeeping magazine for his cows, so they have plenty of material to read while waiting around in the barn during milking sessions. Unfortunately, the latest issue contains a rather inappropriate article on how to cook the perfect steak, which FJ would rather his cows not see (clearly, the magazine is in need of better editorial oversight).</p>
<p style="font-family: Raleway, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">FJ has taken all of the text from the magazine to create the string S of length at most 10^6 characters. From this, he would like to remove occurrences of a substring T to censor the inappropriate content. To do this, Farmer John finds the _first_ occurrence of T in S and deletes it. He then repeats the process again, deleting the first occurrence of T again, continuing until there are no more occurrences of T in S. Note that the deletion of one occurrence might create a new occurrence of T that didn't exist before.</p>
<p style="font-family: Raleway, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">Please help FJ determine the final contents of S after censoring is complete</p>
<p style="font-family: Raleway, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">有一个S串和一个T串，长度均小于1,000,000，设当前串为U串，然后从前往后枚举S串一个字符一个字符往U串里添加，若U串后缀为T，则去掉这个后缀继续流程。</p>

## 输入格式
