## 题目描述

<div>
 Farmer John is continuing to ponder the issue of cows crossing the road through his farm, introduced
</div>
<div>
  in the preceding problem. He realizes that interaction between some pairs of breeds is actually acc
</div>
<div>
 eptable if the breeds are friendly, a property that turns out to be easily characterized in terms of
</div>
<div>
  breed ID: breeds aa and bb are friendly if |a-b|≤4, and unfriendly otherwise. It is ok for cows to
</div>
<div>
  wander into fields designated for other breeds, as long as they are friendly.Given the ordering of 
</div>
<div>
 N fields on both sides of the road through FJ's farm (again, with exactly one field for each breed o
</div>
<div>
 n each side), please help FJ determine the maximum number of crosswalks he can draw over his road, s
</div>
<div>
 uch that no two intersect, and such that each crosswalk joins a pair of fields containing two breeds
</div>
<div>
  that are friendly. Each field can be accessible via at most one crosswalk (so crosswalks don't meet
</div>
<div>
  at their endpoints).
</div>
<div>
 <div>
  上下有两个长度为n、位置对应的序列A、B，
 </div>
 <div>
  其中数的范围均为1~n。若abs(A[i]-B[j]) <= 4，
 </div>
 <div>
  则A[i]与B[j]间可以连一条边。现要求在边与边不相交的情况下的最大的连边数量。
 </div>
 <div>
  n <= 10^5。
 </div>

## 输入格式

<div>
 The first line of input contains N (1≤N≤100,0000). 
</div>
<div>
 The next N lines describe the order, by breed ID, of fields on one side of the road; 
</div>
<div>
 each breed ID is an integer in the range 1…N 
</div>
<div>
 The last N lines describe the order, by breed ID, of the fields on the other side of the road. 
</div>
<div>
 Each breed ID appears exactly once in each ordering.
</div>
<div>
 注意:<span style="font-family: arial, verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">两个序列都是全排列</span>
</div>
<div></div>
<p></p>

## 输出格式
