## 题目描述

<div>
 You are given a sequence of white (W) and black (B) bricks. The goal is to partition it into 
</div>
<div>
 some number of non-empty, contiguous blocks, each one having the same ratio of white and black 
</div>
<div>
 bricks. 
</div>
<div>
 Of course one can always "partition'7 the sequence into one single block (which is not very 
</div>
<div>
 interesting). We want, however, to have as manv blocks as possible. Consider for example the 
</div>
<div>
 following sequences and its partitions: 
</div>
<div>
 ●BWWWBB 
</div>
<div>
 BW + WWBB (rati0 1:1) 
</div>
<div>
 ~ WWWBBBWWWWWWWWWB 
</div>
<div>
 WWWB + BBWWWWWW + WWWB (rati0 3:1) 
</div>
<div>
 Note that both of these partitions are optimal with respect to the number of blocks 
</div>
<div></div>
<p></p>

## 输入格式

<div>
 The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. The descriptions of the test cases 
</div>
<div>
 follow: 
</div>
<div>
 Each test case starts with one line containing an integer n (1《 n≤ 105) which is the length of 
</div>
<div>
 the description of a sequence. Each of the following n lines consists of an integer k (1≤ k < 10^9) 
</div>
<div>
 and one of the characters W or B, meaning that k bricks of the given color follow next in the 
</div>
<div>
 sequence. It is guaranteed that the total length of the brick sequence does not exceed 10^9. 
</div>
<div></div>
<p></p>

## 输出格式

<div>
 For each test case, output a single line containing the largest possible number of blocks
