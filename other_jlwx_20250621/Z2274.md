## 题目描述

<p><span style="font-size: medium"><br>
   Farmer John's N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows are lined up in a row and<br>
   numbered 1..N. The cows are conducting another one of their strange<br>
   protests, so each cow i is holding up a sign with an integer A_i<br>
   (-10,000 <= A_i <= 10,000).<br><br>
   FJ knows the mob of cows will behave if they are properly grouped<br>
   and thus would like to arrange the cows into one or more contiguous<br>
   groups so that every cow is in exactly one group and that every<br>
   group has a nonnegative sum.<br><br>
   Help him count the number of ways he can do this, modulo 1,000,000,009.<br><br>
   By way of example, if N = 4 and the cows' signs are 2, 3, -3, and<br>
   1, then the following are the only four valid ways of arranging the<br>
   cows:<br><br>
   (2 3 -3 1)<br>
   (2 3 -3) (1)<br>
   (2) (3 -3 1)<br>
   (2) (3 -3) (1)<br><br>
   Note that this example demonstrates the rule for counting different<br>
   orders of the arrangements.<br><br>
   给出n个数，问有几种划分方案（不能改变数的位置），使得每组中数的和大于等于0。输出方案数除以 1000000009的余数。<br></span></p>
