<div>
 A gambling machine consists of n generators of integers: G1, ..., Gn, where 1 <= n <= 1000. The gene

 Task 
</div>
<div>
 Write a program that: 
</div>
<div>
 Reads from the text file HAZ.IN the description of the machine, i.e. the number of generators n, integers ki and sets Si, 
</div>
<div>
 Verifies, whether the machine described in the input file is well constructed, 
</div>
<div>
 if it is well constructed, writes a sequence of integers, which may be generated by the machine, is ended with zero, and does not lead to defeat, 
</div>
<div>
 if not, writes one word NIE ("no" in Polish) in the text file HAZ.OUT.

## 输入格式

<div>
 In the first line there is written one positive integer n <= 1000. 
</div>
<div>
 This is the number of generators. 
</div>
<div>
 In the (i + 1)?st line (for i = 1,..., n) there is written an integer ki 
</div>
<div>
 followed by all the elements of the set Si (written in arbitrary order). 
</div>
<div>
 The integers in each line are separated by single spaces.
</div>

## 输出格式

<div>
 there should be written one word NIE (if the machine isn't well constructed) or 
</div>
<div>
 one line containing an appropriate finite series of integers separated by single spaces.
</div>

```input1
For the input file HAZ1.IN: 2 2 1 2 1 2 For the input file HAZ2.IN: 2 1 2 0
```
```output1
the correct answer is the output file HAZ1.OUT: 2 2 0  the correct answer is the output file HAZ2.OUT: NIE
```
