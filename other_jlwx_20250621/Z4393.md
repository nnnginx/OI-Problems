## 题目描述

<p>Bessie has broken into Farmer John's house again! She has discovered a pile of lemons and a pile of oranges in the kitchen (effectively an unlimited number of each), and she is determined to eat as much as possible.<br><br>
  Bessie has a maximum fullness of T (1≤T≤5,000,000). Eating an orange increases her fullness by A, and eating a lemon increases her fullness by B (1≤A,B≤T). Additionally, if she wants, Bessie can drink water at most one time, which will instantly decrease her fullness by half (and will round down).<br><br>
  Help Bessie determine the maximum fullness she can achieve!</p>

<p>奶牛Bessie潜入了农夫约翰的家，她发现这里有无穷无尽的柠檬派和橘子派。</p>
<p>Bessie的饱胀值一开始是0，且上限是T，每个柠檬派可以提供A点饱胀值，每个橘子派可以提供B点饱胀值。</p>
<p>Bessie可以不断地吃东西，如果她的饱胀值没有超出T的话。同时，Bessie有一次喝水的机会，喝完后，她的饱胀值将减少一半（往下取整）。</p>
<p>请计算出Bessie的饱胀值最多可以达到多少。</p>
