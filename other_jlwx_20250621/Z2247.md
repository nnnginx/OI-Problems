<div class="ptx" lang="en-US">
 In the downtown of Bucharest there is a very big bank with a very big vault. Inside the vault there are N very big boxes numbered from 1 to N. Inside the box with number k there are k very big diamonds, each of weight Wk and cost Ck. 
 <br> John and Brus are inside the vault at the moment. They would like to steal everything, but unfortunately they are able to carry diamonds with the total weight not exceeding M. 
 <br> Your task is to help John and Brus to choose diamonds with the total weight less than or 
 <br> equal to M and the maximal possible total cost.
