   Farmer John decides to build a new fence around parts of his farm, but he keeps getting distracted a

  <div>

  <div>

## 输出格式

<div>
 Write out a single integer giving the minimum number of gates FJ needs to build to restore complete connectivity to all regions of his farm. Note that the answer could be zero if the farm is connected to begin with.
