## 题目描述

<div>
 After solves all problem of the series COT(count on a tree), ZCC feels bored and came up with a new COT problem, where letter T stands of Tetrahedron.
</div>
<div>
 In this problem, Tetrahedron is define as a set of point:
</div>
<div>
 T(n) = {(x, y, z) | 1≤z≤y≤x≤n}
</div>
<div>
 Imagine T(n) is divided into n layers, the k-th layer contains k rows, of which the l-th row contains l points.
</div>
<div>
 Moreover, we define sub-Tetrahedron a set of point, too:
</div>
<div>
 sT(x, y, z, a) = {(x+i, y+j, z+k) | 0≤k≤j≤i＜a}
</div>
<div>
 First of all, you are given a Tetrahedron T(N), every point of T(N) has a value of 0.
</div>
<div>
 Then, you should deal with M operation (Mxi, Myi, Mzi, Mai), means you should add 1 to every point’s value if it belongs to sT(Mxi, Myi, Mzi, Mai).
</div>
<div>
 Then, you should deal with Q queries (Qxi, Qyi, Qzi, Qai), you should output the sum of values of points in sT(Qxi, Qyi, Qzi, Qai).

## 输入格式

<div>
 First line: three positive integer N, M, Q.(N≤100, M≤100000, Q≤100000)
</div>
<div>
 Then followed M lines, each line contains four integers Mxi, Myi, Mzi, Mai, which describe an operation.
</div>
<div>
 Then followed Q lines, each line contains four integers Qxi, Qyi, Qzi, Qai, which describe a query.
</div>
<p></p>

## 输出格式

<div>
 For every query, output a line with one integer, the answer to the query.

1 1 1 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 1 1
```
```output1

```
## 数据范围与约定

<div>
 It is guaranteed, for every sT(x, y, z, a): 1≤z≤y≤x≤x+a-1≤N.
