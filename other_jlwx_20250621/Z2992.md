## 题目描述

<div class="ptx" lang="en-US">
 Mr. Furion is a math teacher. His students are very lazy and they do not like to do their homework. One day, Mr. Furion decides to give them a special problem in order to see whether his students are talents in math or they are just too lazy to do their homework. The problem is: <br> <br> Given an integer k, n integers m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>…m<sub>n</sub>, and a formula below: <br> X<sub>1</sub> xor X<sub>2</sub> xor X<sub>3</sub>… xor X<sub>n</sub> = k <br> Please figure out that how many integral solutions of the formula can satisfy: <br> 0<=X<sub>i</sub><=m<sub>i</sub> (i=1…n)
</div>
<p>给出两个整数K，N和一个整数序列M1,M2...Mn<br> 求满足X1 Xor X2 Xor X3...Xor Xn=k且0<=Xi<=Mi（i=1...n)的解的个数</p>

## 输入格式

<div class="ptx" lang="en-US">
 There are at most 100 test cases. <br> The first line of each test case contains two integers, n and k. The second line of each test case contains n integers: m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>…m<sub>n</sub>. The meaning of n,k, m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>…m<sub>n</sub> are described above. (1<=n<=50,0<=k,m<sub>1</sub>,m<sub>2</sub>…m<sub>n</sub><=2<sup>31</sup>-1 ) <br> The input is ended by “0 0”

## 输出格式

 You should output an integer for each test case, which is the number of solutions. As the number might be very large, you should only output the number modulo 1000000003.
