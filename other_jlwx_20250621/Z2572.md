One day, someone decided to break the rule and bake a hexagonally shaped cake. But as usual, he has to serve the cake in triangular pieces. The pieces are equilateral triangles but in different sizes for different people. He can use as many triangles as needed to cut the cake into pieces, such that nothing remains from the cake. For example, the following figure shows one way that a hexagon with side 9 can be cut into triangles with side 2 and 3. (The cake is cut along the thick lines, thin lines are drawn to show the sizes).</font></span></p> </span><span style="font-size: medium"> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify"></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: medium"><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman"><img alt="" src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/15/m9nwF6Jfv4DGqAk.png"></font></span></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify"></p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify"></p> </span>

## 输入格式

<div style="text-justify: inter-ideograph">
 <span style="font-size: medium">The first line of the input file contains a single integer <i>t </i>(1 £ <i>t</i> £ 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. Each test case consists of a single line, containing <i>s </i>(1 <= <em>s</em><= 25), the length of the hexagon's side, followed by <i>n</i>, the number of triangle types (1 <= <i>n</i> <= 10), followed by <i>n</i> integers representing the length of each triangle type's side (between 1 and 25, inclusive).</span>
