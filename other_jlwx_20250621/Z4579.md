<div>
 M bidirectional paths between some pairs of barns (1≤N,M≤200,000). To shut the farm down, FJ plans

<div>
 sing) whether his farm is "fully connected" -- meaning that it is possible to travel from any open b
</div>
<div>
 arn to any other open barn along an appropriate series of paths. Since FJ's farm is initially in som
