## 题目描述

<div class="problem-text" align="left">
 <span style="font-size: medium; "><span class="mono prewrap" id="probtext-text">Bessie is playing a video game! In the game, the three letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' are the only valid buttons. Bessie may press the buttons in any order she likes; however, there are only N distinct combos possible (1 <= N <= 20). Combo i is represented as a string S_i which has a length between 1 and 15 and contains only the letters 'A', 'B', and 'C'. Whenever Bessie presses a combination of letters that matches with a combo, she gets one point for the combo. Combos may overlap with each other or even finish at the same time! For example if N = 3 and the three possible combos are "ABA", "CB", and "ABACB", and Bessie presses "ABACB", she will end with 3 points. Bessie may score points for a single combo more than once. Bessie of course wants to earn points as quickly as possible. If she presses exactly K buttons (1 <= K <= 1,000), what is the maximum number of points she can earn? </span></span>
