## 题目描述

<div>
 Winning the election was simpler than you expected: it was enough to promise to finally build 
</div>
<div>
 a good quality, country-wide road infrastructure, of course without crippling the budget_ Your 
</div>
<div>
 happiness did not last long, however: it seems, that the citizens have found a way to actually 
</div>
<div>
 hold you accountable for your promise! 
</div>
<div>
 There are n major cities in your country. The Ministry of Transport has prepared a detailed 
</div>
<div>
 map, outlining m possible highway connections, together with their costs. The Quality Assurance 
</div>
<div>
 Committee will not let you build a highway cheaper than l, and the National Spendings 
</div>
<div>
 Regulatory Committee will not let you build a highway more expensive than h. To claim a 
</div>
<div>
 "country-wide" network, you have to connect (possibly indirectly) as many pairs of cities, as it is 
</div>
<div>
 possible within these two constraints. You have to find the cheapest way to do it, and you have 
</div>
<div>
 to find it quickly! Of all networks that meet the constraints and connect the most pairs of cities, 
</div>
<div>
 compute the cost of the cheapest one. 
</div>
<div>
 To make things worse, both committees are heavily influenced by your angry competitors: 
</div>
<div>
 each time you publish your hard-prepared plan, they immediatelv change their rulings l and矗， 
</div>
<div>
 and vou are forced to start from scratch. 
</div>
<div>
 有N个点，M条无向虚边（边还未连接上去），Q组询问，询问格式如下： 
</div>
<div>
 对于第一个询问输入2个数L1,H1,表示你要用满足权值L1<=Ai<=H1的所有边来连接点使得能互相通达的点的数量最多。在此条件下，输出最小的权值和C1. 对于第i个询问(1

 N<=1000, M<=100000, Q<=1000000

## 输入格式

<div>
 The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. The descriptions of the test cases 
</div>
<div>
 <div>
  follow: 
 </div>
 <div>
  The first line of each test case contains integers n and m (1≤ n≤ 1000; 0≤ rn≤ 100 000) - 
 </div>
 <div>
  the number of cities in the country, and of possible direct connections, respectively. 
 </div>
 <div>
  Each of the following m lines contains three integers x,y,w (1 < x≠ y < n; I≤ w≤ 
 </div>
 <div>
  1000 000), denoting that the cities x and y can be connected by a bidirectional highway at cost 
 </div>
 <div>
  w. There might be many ways to connect a single pair of cities. 
 </div>
 <div>
  The following line contains an integer q (1《 q < 1 000 000) - the number of rulings of the 
 </div>
 <div>
  committees. Each of the following q lines contains two integers. The first of the lines contains 
 </div>
 <div>
  the initial rulings 21, hi, given directly. The rest of the rulings are encoded. The numbers in the 
 </div>
 <div>
  j-th of the lines for j > I are lj + Cj_i and hj + cj_i, where lj and hj are the actual rulings and 
 </div>
 <div>
  cj-l is the correct answer for the preceding rulings /j_i and hj_i. 
 </div>
 <div>
  All rulings satisfv I≤ tj≤ hj < 1000 000. 
 </div>
 <div></div>
</div>
<p></p>

## 输出格式

<div>
 For each test case, output q lines, one for 
</div>
<div>
 cost cj of building a highway network which 
</div>
<div>
 the maximum number of connected pairs of 
</div>
<div>
 each ruling. In the j-th of them, output the minimal 
</div>
<div>
 adheres to the committees7 constraints, and creates 
</div>
<div>
 cities.

<div>
 样例解释： 
</div>
<br>
<div>
 第一组询问1 2，连接1 2 2和4 5 1两条边，总权值为3.因为没有其他边的权值范围在[1,2]了
