## 题目描述

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The N (1 <= N <= 20) cows conveniently numbered 1...N are playing <br>
   yet another one of their crazy games with Farmer John. The cows <br>
   will arrange themselves in a line and ask Farmer John what their <br>
   line number is. In return, Farmer John can give them a line number <br>
   and the cows must rearrange themselves into that line. <br>
   A line number is assigned by numbering all the permutations of the <br>
   line in lexicographic order. <br><br>
   Consider this example: <br>
   Farmer John has 5 cows and gives them the line number of 3. <br>
   The permutations of the line in ascending lexicographic order: <br>
   1st: 1 2 3 4 5 <br>
   2nd: 1 2 3 5 4 <br>
   3rd: 1 2 4 3 5 <br>
   Therefore, the cows will line themselves in the cow line 1 2 4 3 5. <br><br>
   The cows, in return, line themselves in the configuration "1 2 5 3 4" and <br>
   ask Farmer John what their line number is. <br><br>
   Continuing with the list: <br>
   4th : 1 2 4 5 3 <br>
   5th : 1 2 5 3 4 <br>
   Farmer John can see the answer here is 5 <br><br>
   Farmer John and the cows would like your help to play their game. <br>
   They have K (1 <= K <= 10,000) queries that they need help with. <br>
   Query i has two parts: C_i will be the command, which is either 'P' <br>
   or 'Q'. <br><br>
   If C_i is 'P', then the second part of the query will be one integer <br>
   A_i (1 <= A_i <= N!), which is a line number. This is Farmer John <br>
   challenging the cows to line up in the correct cow line. <br><br>
   If C_i is 'Q', then the second part of the query will be N distinct <br>
   integers B_ij (1 <= B_ij <= N). This will denote a cow line. These are the <br>
   cows challenging Farmer John to find their line number. <br><br>
   有N头牛，分别用1……N表示，排成一行。 <br>
   将N头牛，所有可能的排列方式，按字典顺序从小到大排列起来。 <br>
   例如：有5头牛 <br>
   1st: 1 2 3 4 5 <br>
   2nd: 1 2 3 5 4 <br>
   3rd: 1 2 4 3 5 <br>
   4th : 1 2 4 5 3 <br>
   5th : 1 2 5 3 4 <br>
   …… <br>
   现在，已知N头牛的排列方式，求这种排列方式的行号。 <br>
   或者已知行号，求牛的排列方式。 <br>
   所谓行号，是指在N头牛所有可能排列方式，按字典顺序从大到小排列后，某一特定排列方式所在行的编号。 <br>
   如果，行号是3，则排列方式为1 2 4 3 5 <br>
   如果，排列方式是 1 2 5 3 4 则行号为5 <br><br>
   有K次问答，第i次问答的类型，由C_i来指明，C_i要么是‘P’要么是‘Q’。 <br>
   当C_i为P时，将提供行号，让你答牛的排列方式。当C_i为Q时，将告诉你牛的排列方式，让你答行号。 <br><br></font></p>

## 输入格式

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and K <br>
   * Lines 2..2*K+1: Line 2*i and 2*i+1 will contain a single query. <br>
   Line 2*i will contain just one character: 'Q' if the cows are lining <br>
   up and asking Farmer John for their line number or 'P' if Farmer <br>
   John gives the cows a line number. <br><br>
   If the line 2*i is 'Q', then line 2*i+1 will contain N space-separated <br>
   integers B_ij which represent the cow line. If the line 2*i is 'P', <br>
   then line 2*i+1 will contain a single integer A_i which is the line <br>
   number to solve for. <br><br>
   第1行：N和K <br>
   第2至2*K+1行：Line2*i ，一个字符‘P’或‘Q’，指明类型。 <br>
   如果Line2*i是P，则Line2*i+1，是一个整数，表示行号； <br>
   如果Line2*i+1 是Q ，则Line2+i，是N个空格隔开的整数，表示牛的排列方式。</font></p>
<p></p>

## 输出格式

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">* Lines 1..K: Line i will contain the answer to query i. <br><br>
   If line 2*i of the input was 'Q', then this line will contain a <br>
   single integer, which is the line number of the cow line in line <br>
   2*i+1. <br><br>
   If line 2*i of the input was 'P', then this line will contain N <br>
   space separated integers giving the cow line of the number in line <br>
   2*i+1. <br>
   第1至K行：如果输入Line2*i 是P，则输出牛的排列方式；如果输入Line2*i是Q，则输出行号</font></p>
