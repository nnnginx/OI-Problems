## 题目描述

<div>
 Teacher Mai has a directed graph with n nodes and n edges. This graph is special: Out degree of each node is 1, and there is no self loop.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 For every node Teacher Mai wrote down a set of nodes which directly links to this node.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 For example, the graph contains 4 edges: {1->2,2->4,3->1,4->1}, the set of each node is {3,4},{1},{},{2}
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 But Teacher Mai found that he forgot writing which node the set belonged to.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 Teacher Mai wanted to recover it, but he found there are many graphs with the same node sets.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 You should count the number of different graphs have the same node sets as the given one.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 The number can be very large, just output the number modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 If there is no solution, the answer is 0.
</div>

## 输入格式

<div>
 There are multiple test cases, terminated by a line "0".
</div>
<div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  For each test case, the first line contains a integer n (1<=n<=1000).
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  The following are n lines representing the set of each node. For every line, there is a integer p first, indicating the size of the set. Then there are p integers, indicating the node with index from 1 to n in this set.
 </div>
</div>
<p></p>

## 输出格式

<div>
 <div>
  For each test case, output one line "Case #k: ans", where k is the case number, counting from 1, ans is the number module 10^9+7.
 </div>
</div>
