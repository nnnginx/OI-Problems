## 题目描述

<p><span style="font-size: medium; ">Oh those picky N (1 <= N <= 50,000) cows! They are so picky that each one will only be milked over some precise time interval A..B (1 <= A <= B <= 1,000,000), which includes both times A and B. Obviously, FJ must create a reservation system to determine which stall each cow can be assigned for her milking time. Of course, no cow will share such a private moment with other cows. Help FJ by determining: * The minimum number of stalls required in the barn so that each cow can have her private milking period * An assignment of cows to these stalls over time </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; ">有N头牛,每头牛有个喝水时间,这段时间它将专用一个Stall 现在给出每头牛的喝水时间段,问至少要多少个Stall才能满足它们的要求</span></p>
