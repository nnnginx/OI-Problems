## 题目描述

<p><span style="font-size: medium">Some brave warriors come to a lost village. They are very lucky and find a lot <br> of treasures and a big treasure chest, but with angry zombies. <br> The warriors are so brave that they decide to defeat the zombies and then <br> bring all the treasures back. A brutal long-drawn-out battle lasts from morning to <br> night and the warriors find the zombies are undead and invincible. <br> Of course, the treasures should not be left here. Unfortunately, the warriors <br> cannot carry all the treasures by  the treasure chest due to the  limitation of  the <br> capacity of the chest. Indeed, there are only two types of treasures: emerald and <br> sapphire.  All  of  the emeralds  are equal in size and value, and with infinite <br> quantities. So are sapphires. <br> Being the priest of the warriors with the magic artifact: computer, and given <br> the size of the chest, the value and size of each types of gem, you should compute <br> the maximum value of treasures our warriors could bring back. </span></p>
