## 题目描述

<div>
 Bessie has invented a new programming language, but since there is no compiler yet, she needs your h
</div>
<div>
 elp to actually run her programs.COWBASIC is a simple, elegant language. It has two key features: ad
</div>
<div>
 dition and MOO loops. Bessie has devised a clever solution to overflow: all addition is done modulo 
</div>
<div>
 109+7. But Bessie's real achievement is the MOO loop, which runs a block of code a fixed number of t
</div>
<div>
 imes. MOO loops and addition can, of course, be nested.Given a COWBASIC program, please help Bessie 
</div>
<div>
 determine what number it returns.

## 输入格式

<div>
 You are given a COWBASIC program at most 100 lines long, with each line being at most 350 characters
</div>
<div>
  long. A COWBASIC program is a list of statements.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 There are three types of statements:
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 <variable> = <expression>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 <literal> MOO {
</div>
<div>
   <list of statements>
</div>
<div>
 }
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 RETURN <variable>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 There are three types of expressions:
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 <literal>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 <variable>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 ( <expression> ) + ( <expression> )
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 A literal is a positive integer at most 100,000.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 A variable is a string of at most 10 lowercase English letters.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 It is guaranteed that no variable will be used or RETURNed before it is defined. It is guaranteed th
</div>
<div>
 at RETURN will happen exactly once, on the last line of the program.
</div>
<div></div>
<p></p>

## 输出格式

<div>
 <div>
  Output a single positive integer, giving the value of the RETURNed variable.
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  Scoring
 </div>
 <div></div>
 <div>
  In 20 percent of all test cases - MOO loops are not nested.
 </div>
 <div>
  In another 20 percent of all test cases - The program only has 1 variable. MOO loops can be nested.
 </div>
 <div>
  In the remaining test cases, there are no further restrictions.
