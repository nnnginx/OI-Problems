<div>
 Let us denote one man's DNA sequence as a string consist of letters from ACGT. The similarity of two string S and T is the maximum common subsequence of them, denote by LCS(S,T).
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 After some days, the devil finds that. The kingdom's people's DNA sequence is pairwise different, and each is of length m. And there are 4^m people in the kingdom.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 Then the devil wants to know, for each 0 <= i <= |S|, how many people in this kingdom having DNA sequence T such that LCS(S,T) = i.
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
 You only to tell her the result modulo 10^9+7.
</div>
