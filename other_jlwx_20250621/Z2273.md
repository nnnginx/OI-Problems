<p><br>
  One sunny day farmer John was kidnapped by evil farmer Marcus's<br>
  cows. FJ wasn't too concerned about his forced holiday but wanted<br>
  to make sure that his cows got home safely together.<br><br>
  The cows are spread out in every one of FJ's N (3 <= N <= 200)<br>
  pastures conveniently numbered 1..N. The barn is located at pasture<br>
  1. The farm has an interesting navigation system: at every pasture<br>
  i there are M (1 <= M <= 200) signs S_ij (1 <= S_ij <= N) which one<br>
  could reference as S_i1..S_iM; each sign points the way to a pasture.<br>
  Sometimes a sign points to a path that leads back to the same<br>
  pasture.<br><br>
  Farmer Marcus's cows allow FJ to write a single message to all of<br>
  his cows. FJ's plan is to write a list of sign numbers such that<br>
  any cow who follows those instructions will all arrive at the barn<br>
  when each cow has completed all the instructions.<br><br>
  When a cow starts at a given pasture then she will first follow the<br>
  path indicated by the first sign number on FJ's list. When she<br>
  arrives at the second pasture, she looks at the second sign of FJ's<br>
  list and follows the path marked by that sign. She continues until<br>
  she exhausts the instruction list, at which point she should be at<br>
  the barn.<br><br>
  Find a list of instructions containing no more than 5,000,000 sign<br>
  numbers that will guide every cow, from every pasture, to the barn<br>
  after all instructions are followed.  It is guaranteed that such a<br>
  list exists.<br><br>
  Consider a set of three signs in four pastures that direct the cows<br>
  like these do:<br>
                                 ** Pasture# **<br>
                                1    2    3    4<br>
                       Sign 1   4    4    1    3<br>
                       Sign 2   1    3    2    4<br>
                       Sign 3   4    2    3    1<br><br>
  The set of instructions below will direct cows to the barn from any<br>
  of the four pastures:<br><br>
         Instruction#   Sign#            Instruction#   Sign#<br>
              1           1                   5           3<br>
              2           2                   6           1<br>
              3           1                   7           3<br>
              4           2<br><br>
  The cow in pasture 1 will read sign #1 at time 1 and be directed<br>
  to pasture 4.  At time 2, she is in pasture 4 and (per FJ's<br>
  instructions) read sign #2 and then be directed to pasture 4. Below<br>
  is a table that shows the cow's travels:<br><br>
                    * * * *  Cow in pasture  1  * * * *<br><br>
          Time    CurrentPasture#    WhichSign     Sign->Nextpasture<br>
            1            1               1                4<br>
            2            4               2                4 (same pasture!)<br>
            3            4               1                3<br>
            4            3               2                2<br>
            5            2               3                2 (same pasture)<br>
            6            2               1                4<br>
            7            4               3                1 Barn!<br><br>
  Similarly: Pasture 2's cow visits pastures [2]-4-4-3-2-2-4-1. <br>
             Pasture 3's cow visits pastures [3]-1-1-4-4-1-4-1.<br>
             Pasture 4's cow visits pastures [4]-3-2-4-4-1-4-1.<br><br>
  Given a set of signs, create a set of instructions.<br></p>
