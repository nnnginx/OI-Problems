  bovine painter, Picowso.Picowso paints in a very particularway. She starts with an N×N blank canvas
 </div>
 <div>
  , represented by an N×N grid of zeros, where a zero indicates an empty cell of the canvas. She then
 </div>
 <div>
  draws N2 rectangles on the canvas, one in each of N2 colors (conveniently numbered 1…N2). For examp
 </div>
 <div>
  le, she might start by painting a rectangle in color 2, giving this intermediate canvas:

## 输入格式

 The first line of input contains N, the size of the canvas (1≤N≤1000). The next N lines describe t

<div>
 he final picture of the canvas, each containing N integers that are in the range 0…N^2. The input i

In this example, color 2 could have been the first to be painted. Color 3 clearly had to have been p
ainted after color 7, and color 7 clearly had to have been painted after color 2. Since we don't see
the other colors, we deduce that they also could have been painted first.
