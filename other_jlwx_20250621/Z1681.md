## 题目描述

<p><span style="font-size: medium">A crime has been comitted: a load of grain has been taken from the barn by one of FJ's cows. FJ is trying to determine which of his C (1 <= C <= 100) cows is the culprit. Fortunately, a passing satellite took an image of his farm M (1 <= M <= 70000) seconds before the crime took place, giving the location of all of the cows. He wants to know which cows had time to get to the barn to steal the grain. Farmer John's farm comprises F (1 <= F <= 500) fields numbered 1..F and connected by P (1 <= P <= 1,000) bidirectional paths whose traversal time is in the range 1..70000 seconds (cows walk very slowly). Field 1 contains the barn. It takes no time to travel within a field (switch paths). Given the layout of Farmer John's farm and the location of each cow when the satellite flew over, determine set of cows who could be guilty. NOTE: Do not declare a variable named exactly 'time'. This will reference the system call and never give you the results you really want. </span></p>
