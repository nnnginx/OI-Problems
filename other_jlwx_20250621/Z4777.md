## 题目描述

<div>
 Farmer John has recently been experimenting with cultivating different types of grass on his farm, r
</div>
<div>
 ealizing that different types of cows like different types of grass. However, he must be careful to 
</div>
<div>
 ensure that different types of grass are planted sufficiently far away from each-other, in order to 
</div>
<div>
 prevent them from being inextricably mixed.FJ's farm consists of Nfields (1≤N≤200,000), where M pa
</div>
<div>
 irs of fields are connected by bi-directional pathways (1≤M≤200,000). Using these pathways, it is 
</div>
<div>
 possible to walk from any field to any other field. Each pathway has an integer length in the range 
</div>
<div>
 1…1,000,000. Any pair of fields will be linked by at most one direct pathway.In each field, FJ init
</div>
<div>
 ially plants one of Ktypes of grass (1≤K≤N). Over time, however, he might decide to switch the gra
</div>
<div>
 ss in some field to a different type. He calls this an "update" operation. He might perform several 
</div>
<div>
 updates over the course of time, which are all cumulative in nature.After each update, FJ would like
</div>
<div>
  to know the length of the shortest path between two fields having different grass types. That is, a
</div>
<div>
 mong all pairs of fields having different grass types, he wants to know which two are closest. Ideal
</div>
<div>
 ly, this number is large, so he can prevent grass of one type from mixing with grass of another type
</div>
<div>
 . It is guaranteed that the farm will always have at least two fields with different grass types.In 
</div>
<div>
 30 percent of the input cases, each field will be directly connected to at most 10 pathways.

## 输入格式

<div>
 The first line of input contains four integers, N, M, K, and Q, where Q is the number of updates (1
</div>
<div>
 ≤Q≤200,000). The next M lines describe the paths; each one contains three integers A, B, and L, in
</div>
<div>
 dicating a path from field A to field B (both integers in the range 1…N) of length L. The next line
</div>
<div>
  indicates the initial type of grass growing in each field (N integers in the range 1…K). Finally, 
</div>
<div>
 the last Q lines each describe an update, specified by two integers A and B, where the grass in fiel
</div>
<div>
 d A is to be updated to type B
</div>
<p></p>

## 输出格式

<div>
 For each update, print the length of the shortest path between two fields with different types of grass
</div>
<div>
 <div>
  after the update is applied.
