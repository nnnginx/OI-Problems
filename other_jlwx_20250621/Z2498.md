## 题目描述

<div class="panel_content">
 <span style="font-size: medium">  Xavier, a 9-year-old student, loves playing many kinds of puzzles. One of his favourites is the following:<br>
     Xerier, his classmate, has made many cards. She writes down a single positive number on each of them. No numbers written on different cards are the same. After that she writes down an equation, whose right side is a single positive number chosen by her, and the left side is the sum of p integers:<br><br>
     Then she asks Xavier put p cards on the corresponding Xi’s position to make this equation correct, with an additional condition that Xi should be ordered from smaller to bigger, i.e.<br>
     Every time Xavier immediately comes up with many solutions. Now he wants to know how many solutions in total are there for any n given by Xerier.<br></span>

## 输入格式

<p><span style="font-size: medium">  There are multiple test cases. The number of them is given in the beginning of the input. Then a series of input block comes one by one.<br>
     For each test case:<br>
     The first line contains two space-separated integers m and p (1<=p<=5). The second line contains m distinct positive integers - the numbers written on each of the cards. None of these integers exceeds 13000.<br>
     There are about 120 test cases in total, but 90% of them are relatively small. More precisely, all numbers are less than or equal to 100 in 90% of the test cases.<br></span></p>

## 输出格式

<div class="panel_content">
 <span style="font-size: medium">  For each test case:<br>
     For each positive integer, output the number of ways in a single line. To keep the output finite, only numbers with positive ways should be outputted.<br>
     Output a blank line after each test case. See sample for more format details.<br></span>
