# OI-Problems

This article has some important info, so be sure to read it all!

The Olympiad in Informatics is abbreviated as OI.

This is a collection of many OI problems that is constantly expanding. To keep copyright issues in check, this project can't be used for commercial purposes or to make a profit.

The project is under gradual development, and we will use crawlers to gather problems from a wide range of sources, including school problem banks, famous online judging systems, and classic competitions.

Unfortunately, we don't have time to deduplicate each problem, and we don’t have the energy to organize them into a complete and unified format. So there might be some missing evaluation data, and time and space limits may not be clearly defined. We're hoping more people will join us to improve this situation, and we appreciate your understanding while we work on it.

If you have any question banks you'd like to collect, feel free to raise issues, and we'll do our best to make it happen.

If you encounter garbled text when opening the file, try changing the encoding; we’ve confirmed the file is fine.

Because some questions refer to images from the original website and can't load properly, we'll provide the original website link so you can check out the images manually.
