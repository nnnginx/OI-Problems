# Problem Description

Ignatius likes to write words in reverse way. Given a single line of text which is written by Ignatius, you should reverse all the words and then output them.

# Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single line with several words. There will be at most 1000 characters in a line.

# Output

For each test case, you should output the text which is processed.

# Sample Input

<pre><div>3
olleh !dlrow
m&#39;I morf .udh
I ekil .mca
</div></pre>

# Sample Output

<pre><div>hello world!
I&#39;m from hdu.
I like acm.</div></pre>

# Hint

Remember to use getchar() to read '\\n' after the interger T, then you may use gets() to read a line and process it.
