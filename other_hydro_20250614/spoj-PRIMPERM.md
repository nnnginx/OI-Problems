<p>Given two positive integers n and m, we call m a prime permutation of n, if m is prime and can be obtained by zero or more permutations of the digits of n. Permutations with leading zeros are invalid.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input starts with a positive integer t&lt;10<sup>4</sup> in a single line, then t lines follow.<br> Each of the t lines contains one positive integer n&lt;10<sup>7</sup>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For every n print the number of distinct prime permutations of n in a single line.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2
13
110

<strong>Output:</strong>
2
1
