## Description

<div><p>Kmes has written three integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ in order to remember that he has to give Noobish_Monk $a \times b \times c$ bananas.</p><p>Noobish_Monk has found these integers and decided to do the following <span class="tex-font-style-bf">at most</span> $5$ times:</p><ul> <li> pick one of these integers; </li><li> increase it by $1$. </li></ul><p>For example, if $a = 2$, $b = 3$ and $c = 4$, then one can increase $a$ three times by one and increase $b$ two times. After that $a = 5$, $b = 5$, $c = 4$. Then the total number of bananas will be $5 \times 5 \times 4 = 100$.</p><p>What is the maximum value of $a \times b \times c$ Noobish_Monk can achieve with these operations?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$)&nbsp;！ the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ ($1 \le a, b, c \le 10$)&nbsp;！ Kmes's integers.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;！ the maximum amount of bananas Noobish_Monk can get.</p></div>

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$)&nbsp;！ the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ ($1 \le a, b, c \le 10$)&nbsp;！ Kmes's integers.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;！ the maximum amount of bananas Noobish_Monk can get.</p>
