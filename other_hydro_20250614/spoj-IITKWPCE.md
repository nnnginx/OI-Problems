<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feluda likes palindromes very much. He is so fond of palindromes that if you give him any string, he will try to break it into continous palindromes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As Feluda is a smart boy, he will do try to break the string into minimum no of such continuous palindromes.
