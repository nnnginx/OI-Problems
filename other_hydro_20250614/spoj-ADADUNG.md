<p>As you might know Ada the Ladybug is farmer. Last year, she sowed <strong>N</strong> distinct types of grain to <strong>N</strong> distinct places. This year she wants to seed the same types of grain again, yet there is a little problem: each type of grain needs special kind of manure, yet fertilizing soil with same kind of manure in consecutive years might destroy it.</p>
<p>Now she is asking you to count the number of ways, to seed <strong>N</strong> types of grain to <strong>N</strong> places in such way that no type of grain will be in its original place. Since this number might be pretty big, print it modulo <strong>10<sup>9</sup>+7</strong>.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains <strong>1 ¡Ü T ¡Ü 10<sup>5</sup> </strong>, number of test-cases.</p>
<p>Each of following <strong>T</strong> lines contains <strong> 1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü     10<sup>7</sup></strong>, number of types/places.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print the number of possibilities for given number of types/places modulo 1000000007.</p>
