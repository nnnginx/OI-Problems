<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 7.2px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">In a badminton tournament, each of n players play all the other n-1 players. Each game results in either a win, or a loss. The players then write down the names of those whom they defeated(say list 1), and also of those who they(players of list 1) defeated. For example, if A beats B and B beats C, then A writes the names of both B and C.&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 7.2px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Consider a game between A,B,C,D,E,F,G where A defeats B and C and B defeats E,F, C defeats E. Then A's list will have (B,C,E,F), and will not include G.</div>
<p>In a badminton tournament, each of <span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span> players play all the other <span style="font-weight: bold;">n - 1</span> players. Each game results in either a win, or a loss. Players then write down the names of those whom they defeated(say list 1) and also of those who they(players of list 1) defeated. For example, if <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> beats <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span> beats <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>, then <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> writes the names of both <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider a game between <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">D</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">E</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">F</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">G</span> where <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> defeats <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span><span>;</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span> defeats <span style="font-weight: bold;">E</span>; <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> defeats <span style="font-weight: bold;">F</span>.

<p>In this problem, we represent players by integers from 1 to <span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span>.(Both inclusive)</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of input contains an integer <span style="font-weight: bold;">t</span>(number of test cases), each test case starts with an integer <span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span> followed by&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: small;">n<span style="vertical-align: sub;">c<span style="vertical-align: sub;"><span style="vertical-align: sub;">2</span></span></span></span></span>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">i.e n</span>*(<span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span> - 1)/2) lines(results of all matches) each containing two integers <span style="font-weight: bold;">a</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">b</span> seperated by a space which means <span style="font-weight: bold;">a</span> defeated <span style="font-weight: bold;">b</span>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print a line for each test case containing two space seperated integers <span style="font-weight: bold;">p</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">q</span> where <span style="font-weight: bold;">p</span> is the player with maximum possible number of players in his list and <span style="font-weight: bold;">q</span> is that number(maximum possible number of players in a list).<br>In case there are many players with maximum number of players in their list, print minimum of such possibilities of <span style="font-weight: bold;">p</span>.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">t</span> &lt;= 50, <span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span> &lt;= 250, 1 &lt;= <span style="font-weight: bold;">a</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">b</span> &lt;= <span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span></p>
