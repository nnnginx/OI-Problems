## Description

<div><p>Alice got a permutation $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of $[1,2,\ldots,n]$, and Bob got another permutation $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ of $[1,2,\ldots,n]$. They are going to play a game with these arrays.</p><p>In each turn, the following events happen in order:</p><ul> <li> Alice chooses either the first or the last element of her array and removes it from the array; </li><li> Bob chooses either the first or the last element of his array and removes it from the array. </li></ul><p>The game continues for $n-1$ turns, after which both arrays will have exactly one remaining element: $x$ in the array $a$ and $y$ in the array $b$.</p><p>If $x=y$, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Find which player will win if both players play optimally.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1\le t\le10^4$).

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1\le t\le10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 3\cdot 10^5$).</p><p>The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($1\le a_i\le n$, all $a_i$ are distinct)&nbsp;！ the permutation of Alice.</p><p>The next line contains $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$ ($1\le b_i\le n$, all $b_i$ are distinct)&nbsp;！ the permutation of Bob.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3\cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print $\texttt{Alice}$; otherwise, print $\texttt{Bob}$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, Bob can win the game by deleting the same element as Alice did.</p><p>In the second test case, Alice can delete $3$ in the first turn, and then in the second turn, delete the element that is different from the one Bob deleted in the first turn to win the game.</p>
