<p>In the Republic of Remoteland, the people celebrate their independence day every year. However, as it was a long long time ago, nobody can remember when it was exactly. The only thing people can remember is that today, the number of days elapsed since their independence (<em>D</em>) is a perfect square, and moreover it is the largest possible such number one can form as a product of distinct numbers less than or equal to <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>As the years in Remoteland have 1,000,000,007 days, their citizens just need <em>D</em> modulo 1,000,000,007. Note that they are interested in the largest <em>D</em>, not in the largest <em>D</em> modulo 1,000,000,007.</p>
<p><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: black; "><span style="font-size: medium; ">Input</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Every test case is described by a single line with an integer <em>n</em>, (1 ¡Ü <em>n</em> ¡Ü 10,000,000). The input ends with a line containing 0.</p>
<p><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: black; "><span style="font-size: medium; ">Output</span></span></strong></p>
<p>For each test case, output the number of days ago the Republic became independent, modulo 1,000,000,007, one per line.</p>
