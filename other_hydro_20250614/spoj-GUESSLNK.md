<p>I really enjoy setting problem <a href="/problems/GUESSING/">GUESSING</a>. After three years, I decided to set another "kind of interactive" problem based on it.

</p><p>Given a link for GUESSING problem, find the server's response

</p><h3>Specification</h3>
<p>The script runs on server works like this, the URL contains 12 digits, first 6 digits represents <b>SEED</b> generated by random number generator, and it won't change during a guessing session. The last 6 digits represents <b>GUESS</b>, which is the number user just typed. 
</p><p>The unknown part (for you, of course) is an integer function <b>f</b> which is a bijection from [0,999999] to [0,999999]. 
</p><p>The server first generate <b>TARGET</b> = <b>f</b>(<b>SEED</b>), then it compares <b>TARGET</b> and <b>GUESS</b> and give response back to user.
</p><p>for more details on <b>f</b>, it's in format (expr(x) % 1000000), and expr (x) is a expression contains <b>only</b> operation add, subtract, multiply, division, modulo, each <b>exactly once</b>, and every constants are in [0,999999], every variable is x(of course), brackets are allowed.

</p><p>for example, expr(x) could be "x/12-34%(x+1)*56", but it's invalid since <b>f</b> is not a bijection.

</p><p>the modulo/division operations here works well if left side is a negative number, for example, -2 % 5 = 3, -2 / 5 = -1. but it's undefined if the number on the right side is not positive.

</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>each line contains a link in format
"<tt>http://www.spoj.com/problems/GUESSING/XXXXXXYYYYYY/</tt>", where <tt>XXXXXXYYYYYY</tt> contains exactly 12 digit.

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>The server's response, in format "<tt>XAYB</tt>".

</p><h3>Example</h3>
