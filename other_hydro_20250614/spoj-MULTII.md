<p>Given a positive integer <strong>N</strong> (1 &lt;= <strong>N</strong> &lt;= 10000) and some digits, find the smallest positive multiple of <strong>N</strong> whose decimal notation does not contain any of the given digits.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers <strong>N</strong> and <em>m</em> separated by a single space. The second line contains <em>m</em> digits separated by spaces. Input terminates by EOF.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output its case number (starting from 1) and the answer in a single line, or "-1" (without quotes) if the answer doesn't exist.</p>
