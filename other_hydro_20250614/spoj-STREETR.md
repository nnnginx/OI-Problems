<p>
A group of&nbsp;trees&nbsp;is planted along a straight line. KOI is planning to plant more trees so that the distance between two adjacent trees is&nbsp;equal for all trees.
For simplicity, each tree&nbsp;can only&nbsp;be planted on an integer coordinate.</p>

<p>
For example, if&nbsp;4 trees&nbsp;were originally&nbsp;planted on coordinates (1, 3, 7, 13),&nbsp;and if KOI plants&nbsp;3 more trees on coordinates&nbsp;(5, 9, 11), then the distance between two adjacent trees will equal for all trees.
</p>

<p>
Your task is to calculate the&nbsp;minimal number of trees that KOI&nbsp;can plant so that the distance between two adjacent trees will equal for all trees.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first&nbsp;line is an integer N (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000), which denotes the number of already planted trees.</p>
<p>The next&nbsp;N lines will have&nbsp;an integer X (1 &lt;= X &lt;= 1,000,000,000), which&nbsp;denotes the coordinate of each&nbsp;tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can safely assume that the value of&nbsp;X will be unique.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output the minimal number of trees that must be planted.</p>
