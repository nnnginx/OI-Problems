<p>
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence of units that has the property of reading the same in either direction, e.g. 'racecar', 'solos'.

</p><h3>Task</h3>
<p> You are given a number k (2¡Ük¡Ü30000) and a non-empty string S whose length does not exceed 30000 lowercase  letters.
<br> We say two palindromes are different when they start from different positions. How many different palindromes of the length k does S contains?


</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains  K. The second line contains S. K does not exceed the length of S. 

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p> The first and only line should consist of a single number - the number of palindromes found. 
</p><h3>Example</h3>

5
ababab
<b>Output:</b>
