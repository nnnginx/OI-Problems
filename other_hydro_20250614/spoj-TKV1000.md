<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Limited. Each of these corporations controls a number of subsidiaries. The aim in this war is simply</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">to drive the competition out of the market. There are N subsidiaries of Takeover Incorporated and M</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">subsidiaries of Buyout Limited, and you know the market value of each subsidiary.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Each company can designate one of its subsidiaries to perform a takeover. The takeover can either be</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">friendly or hostile. A friendly takeover means a subsidiary of a corporation merges with a different</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">subsidiary of the same corporation. The market value of the merged subsidiary is the sum of the market</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">values of the constituent subsidiaries. There is no constraint on the relative sizes of the subsidiaries</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">participating in a friendly takeover.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">A hostile takeover means a subsidiary A of a corporation attempts to take over a subsidiary B of the</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">other corporation. For this to succeed, the market value of A has to be greater than the market value of</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">B. After this move, B disappears from the market. The market value of A does not change (the gain of</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">incorporating B¡¯s assets is offset by the monetary cost of the takeover). For simplicity we assume that</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">no sequence of moves leads to two subsidiaries of different corporations having the same market value.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">The companies take turns making moves in this takeover war, with Takeover Incorporated going first.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">A company will do nothing on its turn only if it cannot make a takeover. A company loses the takeover</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">war if all its subsidiaries are taken over.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Your aim is to learn which company can guarantee a victory from this war. In the first case of the</div>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">its first move with the 7-value subsidiary. Then it will lose one of its small (1-value) subsidiaries to a</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">hostile takeover, and then it will take over the second subsidiary of Buyout Limited. In the second case,</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Takeover has to make a friendly takeover in its first move. Buyout Limited will join its two subsidiaries</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">into a single company with market value 10. Takeover will have to make a friendly takeover again</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">(as again it will not have a large enough subsidiary to take over Buyout¡¯s giant). Now Takeover will</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">have two subsidiaries, valued either 9 and 3 or 6 and 6. In either case, Buyout takes over one of these</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">subsidiaries, Takeover has to pass, and Buyout takes over the other one.</div>
