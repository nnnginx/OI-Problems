<p>Little Rubdary has been training a lot for the Mathematics and Informatics Olympiads. She has been studying divisibility, and has come with a new problem for you!<br><br>Is there a positive number that is divisible by the first <strong>N </strong>natural numbers? If so, can you find the smallest one?<br>Can you find the answer to <strong>Q</strong> values of <strong>N</strong>?<br><br>You gladly accept this challenge, but with one condition: as the answers may be extremely large, you will show them modulo some number <strong>M</strong></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains two integer <strong>Q </strong>and <strong>M</strong>, which specify the number of questions to be answered and the modulo respectively. Then, will follow the descriptions of the <strong>Q</strong> questions.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each question you must print the answer to the challenge modulo <strong>M</strong> in a single line. In case there is no answer to the question, you must output -1</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
