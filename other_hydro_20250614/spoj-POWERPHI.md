Vertu was very impressed by the golden ratio ¦Õ=(1+¡Ì5)/2 and about it occurring in nature and all that. He now begins to wonder if any non negative integral power of ¦Õ is also special. Since he does not like working with decimals, he decided to approximate the positive integral power of ¦Õ to its closest integer. Help him by printing the closest integer to ¦Õ<sup><b>n</b></sup>, given <b>n</b>.
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. <b>T</b> lines follow, each containing one positive integer <b>n</b>. </p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each of these integers, print the closest integer to ¦Õ<sup><b>n</b></sup>. 
If you think there are two closest possible integers, print either of them. 
Print the answer modulo (10<sup>9</sup>+7).
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><b>T</b> &lt;= 100000</p>
<p>0 &lt;= <b>n</b> &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></p>
