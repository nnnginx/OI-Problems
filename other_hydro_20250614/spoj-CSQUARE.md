<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Marko is learning method of successive squaring so that he can calculate a^b mod m quickly. To give himself practice he wrote many tuples of a, b and m and went to school thinking that he will do it after school.</p>
<p>After school he found that tuples he wrote are modified by his little sister. His sister converted each b into base 3. Marko wrote everything in base 10.<br><br>Help Marko to do his excercise.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of input contains a number T, number of test cases. Then T test cases follows each containing three numbers a (&lt;=10^9), b and m (&lt;=10^5) (a in base 10, b in base 3 and m in base 10). Number of digits in b will be less than 250.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output a number for each test case a^b mod m in base 10.</p>
