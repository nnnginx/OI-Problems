<p>Numbers of black and white points are placed on a plane. Let’s imagine that a straight line of inﬁnite length is drawn on the plane. When the line does not meet any of the points, the line divides these points into two groups. If the division by such a line results in one group consisting only of black points and the other consisting only of white points, we say that the <br>line “separates black and white points”.</p>
<p>Let’s see examples in the figure below. In the leftmost example, you can easily ﬁnd that the black and white points can be perfectly separated by the dashed line according to their colors. In the remaining three examples, there exists no such straight line that gives such a separation.</p>

<p>In this problem, given a set of points with their colors and positions, you are requested to decide whether there exists a straight line that separates black and white points.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input is a sequence of datasets, each of which is formatted as follows.</p>
<p><em>n m</em> <br><em>x</em><sub>1</sub> <em>y</em><sub>1</sub> <br>. <br>. <br>. <br><em>x</em><sub>n</sub> <em>y</em><sub>n</sub> <br><em>x</em><sub>n+1</sub> <em>y</em><sub>n+1</sub> <br>. <br>. <br>. <br><em>x</em><sub>n+m</sub> <em>y</em><sub>n+m</sub></p>
<p>The ﬁrst line contains two positive integers separated by a single space; <strong>n</strong> is the number of black points, and <strong>m</strong> is the number of white points. They are less than or equal to 100. Then<strong> n</strong><em> +</em><strong> m</strong> lines representing the coordinates of points follow. Each line contains two integers x<sub>i</sub> and y<sub>i</sub> separated by a space, where (x<sub>i</sub> , y<sub>i</sub>) represents the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the i-th point. The color of the i-th point is black for <strong><em>1 ≤ i ≤ n</em></strong>, and is white for <strong>n + 1 ≤ i ≤ n + m</strong>. All the points have integral x- and y-coordinate values between 0 and 10000 inclusive. You can also assume that no two points have the same position. <br>The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros separated by a space.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each dataset, output “YES” if there exists a line satisfying the condition. If not, output “NO”. In either case, print it in one line for each input dataset.</p>
