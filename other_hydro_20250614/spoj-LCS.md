<p>A string is finite sequence of   characters over a non-empty finite set ¦².</p>
<p>In this problem, ¦² is the set of  lowercase letters.</p>
<p>Substring, also called factor, is a consecutive  sequence of   characters occurrences at least once in a string.</p>
<p>Now your task is  simple, for two given strings, find the length of the longest common substring  of them.</p>
<p>Here common substring means a substring of two or more  strings.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains exactly two lines, each line consists of no more than   250000 lowercase letters, representing a string.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The length of the longest common substring. If such string doesn't exist,  print "0" instead.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
alsdfkjfjkdsal
fdjskalajfkdsla

<strong>Output:</strong>
3
