You all know about factorization of an integer.&nbsp; Here we want you to factor a number into as few factors as possible.&nbsp; That is easy, you say, just have the number itself, and that will be the smallest number of factors i.e. 1. <br>But wait, I haven't finished -- each of the factors that you find must be square-free.&nbsp; A square-free number, however you factor it, won't have any factor that is a perfect square.&nbsp; Of course, you can never include 1 as a factor.
