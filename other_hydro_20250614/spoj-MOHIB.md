<p><i>Mohib</i> (<img title="Cool" src="../../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-cool.gif" border="0" alt="Cool"><img title="Wink" src="../../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-wink.gif" border="0" alt="Wink">), as we all known, is very brilliant in mathematics. His friend <i>Bar</i> has given him another problem to solve.</p>

<p>Bar gives him a sequence of distinct positive integers, whose average is (A+1).</p>
<p>If Bar append an integer x to the sequence, then the average of integers in the sequence will be A.</p>

<p>He asked the Mohib to tell him the largest possible integer in the sequence.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains T, the number of testcases (T &lt;= 5000).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next T lines contain an integer x (1 &lt;= x &lt;= 49999) and A (x+1 &lt;= A &lt;= 50000).</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print the largest possible integer in the sequence.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Input:</b>
1
1 2

<b>Output:</b>
3</pre>
