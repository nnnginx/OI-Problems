<p>Once Gopu was reading a maths problem which had a weird looking function f as follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1, if n is a prime number.<br><strong>f(n) &nbsp;=</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; f (sum of prime divisors of n) + number of distinct prime divisors of n, &nbsp;otherwise.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }</p>
<p>Compute f (n) for a given value of n.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains T : number of test cases. (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 20)</p>
<p>For each test case, there is a single line containing integer n. (2 &lt;= n &lt;= 10^12).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output value of f (n) in a single line.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
6<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>20<br>123456&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><strong>Output:<br></strong>1<br>1<br>2<br>1<br>3<br>6</pre>
