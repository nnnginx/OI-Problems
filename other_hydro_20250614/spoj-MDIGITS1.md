<p>
Given a positive integer n, your task is to find a positive integer m, 
which is a multiple of n, and that m contains the least number of different
digits when represented in decimal. For example, number 1334 contains three
different digits 1, 3 and 4. 
</p> 

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input consists of no more than 50 test cases. Each test case has only
one line, which contains a positive integer n (1&lt;=n&lt;65536). 
There are no blank lines between cases. A line with a single 0 terminates the input. 
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p> 
For each test case, you should output one line, which contains m. 
If there are several possible results, you should output the smallest one.
