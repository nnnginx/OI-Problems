<p>A string is finite sequence of          characters over a non-empty finite set ¦².</p>
<p>In this problem, ¦² is the set of         lowercase letters.</p>
<p>Substring, also called factor, is a consecutive         sequence of          characters occurrences at least once in a string.</p>
<p>Now your task is a bit        harder, for some given strings, find the length of the longest common substring         of them.</p>
<p>Here common substring means a substring of all the considered strings.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains at most 10 lines, each line consists of no more than 100000 lowercase letters, representing a        string.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The length of the longest common substring. If such string doesn't exist,  print "0" instead.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
alsdfkjfjkdsal
fdjskalajfkdsla
aaaajfaaaa

<strong>Output:</strong>
2
