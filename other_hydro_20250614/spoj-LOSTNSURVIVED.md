<p>On September 22,<sup> </sup>2004, Oceanic Flight 815 crashed on a mysterious island somewhere in the pacific.</p>
<p>There actually were survivors in the crash , N survivors . The mysterious island kept on moving in space - time, so no rescue reached them.</p>
<p>Initially every survivor was on his own .But soon they realized there are these ¡°The Others¡± (Scientists of damn Dharma Initiative) on this Island too.</p>
<p>So to protect themselves from mad Scientists they started uniting into groups after Dr. Shephard &nbsp;said &nbsp;¡° Live together Die alone ¡±.</p>
<p>You have to handle Q queries; which consist of two survivors becoming friends and thereby uniting there respective groups into a &nbsp;larger group.</p>
<p>After each query, output the difference between the group of largest size and group of smallest size at that time.</p>
<p>If there is only one group, output 0. At first, everyone is in their own group.</p>
<p>Also note, if the two survivors in the query are already in the &nbsp;same group, print the current answer, and skip merging groups.</p>
<p>Also do comment if you have watched Lost :-p</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 7.77778px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">The first line consists of two space separated integers, N and Q</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 7.77778px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">The next Q line consists of two integers, A and B, meaning that&nbsp;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 7.77778px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">the groups involving survivor A and survivor B unite into a larger group.</div>
<p>The first line consists of two space separated integers, N and Q</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next Q line consists of two integers, A and B, meaning that&nbsp;</p>
<p>survivor A and survivor B became friends uniting there groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output Q lines, the answer after each query.</p>
