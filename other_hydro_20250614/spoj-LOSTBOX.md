<p>Minas had a box of marble which is lost last week. About that box Minas only know that length and height of the box was <strong>L</strong> and <strong>H</strong>, and box contains <strong>K</strong> marbles. But he forget the width of the box.  But he remember that <strong>width = 2 * radius</strong> of marble and width is also an integer. You can assume that all marble are same.</p>
<p>Now, Minas will give you<strong> L, H </strong>and<strong> K</strong>. You need to tell him the width of the box. If the width is less than 1 then print <strong>-1</strong>.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input starts with an integer <strong>T (1&lt;=T&lt;=1000)</strong>, denoting the number of test cases.<br>Each case contains 3 integer <strong>L (1 ¡Ü L ¡Ü 10^9)</strong>, <strong>H (1 ¡Ü H ¡Ü 10^9)</strong> and <strong>K (1 ¡Ü K ¡Ü 10^9)</strong>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case of input, print the case number as <strong>"Case #: x"</strong>, <strong>#</strong> is replaced by the case number starting from 1 and <strong>x</strong> is replaced by the <strong>maximum possible</strong> width of the box.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
