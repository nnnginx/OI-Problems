<p>Pizzahat has released a new pizza with triangular shaped pieces. This pizza is composed of some equal-sized equilateral triangle. Moreover, all the triangles are connected. Also, if two triangles are directly connected, they must share a common edge.</p>
<p>How many different shapes of this kind of N-pieces pizza are there? <strong>Two patterns are considered as same if they can completely overlap after rotation and shifting (note that flipping is not included).</strong></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases.</p>
<p>For each test case, there is only one line with only one integer N denoting the number of pieces that can be used. (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 16)</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single integer denoting the number of possible different shapes of the pizza.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
3
2
4
10

<strong>Output:</strong>
Case #1: 1
Case #2: 4
Case #3: 866
