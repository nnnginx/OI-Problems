Alp and Gaut are like always opposite to each other. Once Alp told that he can identify a number which is divisible by 252 (He knows because that is his girlfriends birthday - 25/2). Now to come up against Alp, Gaut said he can identify whether the number is divisible by 525 (poor Gaut don't have a girl friend though). The truth is they don't know to do it for big numbers. So you are here to help them with a method. Given a number you have to tell whether the number is divisible by 252 and 525.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Number of testcases in first line, T (T &lt;= 100).</p>
<p>Each line contains one number N, whose divisibility is to be tested (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10<sup>50000</sup>).</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Each line containing two Yes/No. one for 252 and one for 525.</p>
