</p><p>Your task is to avoid the Evil Uncle catching Little Jelly. First of all, you should find out the common area of the gardan and the inhaling circle.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There are multiple test cases in the input file.
First line of each test case are three integers x, y and r, For the coordinate of the center of the inhaling circle.
</p><p>The second line contains four integers x1, y1, x2 and y2. Which are the coordinate of the Gold Garden. The Gold Garden is such a perfect rectangle so that its sides are parallel to the axis.
</p><p>All numbers in the input are integers and do not reach 1000 by their absolute values. Sides of the Golden Garden are non-zero.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test cases, output only one line with one real number which is the common area of the garden and the circle. Your answer must be accurate up to 0.000001.</p>
