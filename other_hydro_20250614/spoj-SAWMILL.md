<p><span style="font-size: small;">There are <img src="file://vK3PH0Xm.png" alt=""> old trees planted along a road that goes from the     top of a hill to its bottom.     Local government decided to cut them down.     In order not to waste wood each tree should be transported     to a sawmill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Trees can be transported only in one direction: downwards.     There is a sawmill at the lower end of the road.     Two additional sawmills can be built along the road.     You have to decide where to build them, as     to minimize the cost of transportation.     The transportation costs one cent per meter, per kilogram of wood.</span></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The first line of the input contains one integer <img src="file://U42GJdmv.png" alt=""> -       the number of trees (<img src="file://oZ2XXJ3m.png" alt="">).       The trees are numbered <img src="file://vIJNUsxj.png" alt="">, starting from the top       of the hill and going downwards.       Each of the following <img src="file://BONZIk4t.png" alt=""> lines contains two positive integers       separated by single space.       Line <img src="file://A6AmiQyW.png" alt=""> contains:       <img src="file://7Ye8WNv9.png" alt=""> - weight (in kilograms) of the <img src="file://gFJLx9oj.png" alt="">-th tree and       <img src="file://xJoVafrY.png" alt=""> - distance (in meters) between trees number <img src="file://EbPFGTZI.png" alt=""> and <img src="file://p3s5iaEn.png" alt="">,       <img src="file://BsrSwhkm.png" alt="">, <img src="file://u1wvyS19.png" alt="">.       The last of these numbers, <img src="file://5yhhdXyj.png" alt="">, is the distance from       the tree number <img src="file://PPbdKsnj.png" alt=""> to the lower end of the road.       It is guaranteed that the total cost of transporting all trees       to the sawmill at the end of the road is less than <img src="file://lY5vW8U1.png" alt=""> cents.</span></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The first and only line of output should contain one integer:       the minimum cost of transportation.</span></p>
