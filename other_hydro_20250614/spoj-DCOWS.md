<p>It's the spring dance and, in a rare occurrence, the N (1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü
5000) bulls have been invited to dance with the M (N &lt; M ¡Ü 5000)
cows (as long as they stay on their very best behavior).</p>

<p>Farmer John, almost obsessive-compulsive in his organization of
dances, wants the spectacle to be as visually attractive as possible.
Thus, he wants to pair up the N bulls with cow partners such that
the total of all the magnitudes of differences in height is minimized.
Bulls have heights B_i (1 ¡Ü B_i ¡Ü 1,000,000) and cows have height
C_i (1 ¡Ü C_i ¡Ü 1,000,000). Of course, some cows will be unmatched
since N-M of them will have no partners; ignore their heights.</p>

<b>INPUT FORMAT:</b><br>
<br>
* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M.<br>
* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: B_i.<br>
* Lines N+2..M+N+1: Line i+N+1 contains a single integer: C_i.<br>
</p>

<p><b>OUTPUT FORMAT:</b><br>
<br>
* Line 1: A single integer that is the minimum of the sum of the absolute value of the height differences that can be achieved.
