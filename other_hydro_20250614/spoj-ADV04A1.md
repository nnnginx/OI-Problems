<p>Daniel is building towers out of blocks. He has many black and white blocks. He has built n towers out of those. Now he suggests Max playing the following game. Black block will belong to Daniel and white blocks will be Max's blocks. During his turn the player can take any of his blocks from any tower and remove it and all the blocks above it.

</p><h3>Constraints</h3>
