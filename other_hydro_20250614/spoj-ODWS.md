Rafa always interested in string problem and playing with string when feel bored. One day he is trying to write all the string which is lexicographically larger than string s and lexicographically smaller than string t and the length of the strings are same as the length of s and t. The string s and t consist of lowercase English letters of same length. After a few moment he got tired and thinking to solve it with computer. As he is so tired he want you to write a program to find how many string exist for the given constrains.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input starts with the number of test cases T (T&lt;=100). Each input contains<br> two lines, the first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), consisting<br> of lowercase English letters. Here, |s| denotes the length of the <br>string.<br><br>The second line contains string t (|t| = |s|), consisting of lowercase English letters.<br><br>It is guaranteed that the lengths of strings s and t are the same and string s is lexicographically less than string t.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print the case number and the result. Since the result may be large you should print the result modulo 1,000,000,007. For better understand check the input and output given below.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
3<br>a<br>d<br>abcdefg<br>abcdefh<br>xy<br>yz

<strong>Output:</strong>
Case 1: 2<br>Case 2: 0<br>Case 3: 26</pre>
