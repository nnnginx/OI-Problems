<p>In the country of Giantarum, the king of Giantarum is AC.AC and his  billions of hougong like to eat giantarum very much. The shape of  giantarum is special! It could be regard as a triangle. There are N  giantarums in the Cartesian coordinates, they may cover each other. AC  wants to know the total area that is covered by giantarums.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<div>
<p>In the first line there is an integer T,  indicates the number of test cases.£¨T&lt;=100£©</p>
<p>In each case, the  first line contains an integer N (N &lt;= 100), indicates the number of  the giantarum. The follow N line, every line contains six floating  numbers x0, y0, x1, y2, x2, y2, indicates the coordinate of the three  vertices of the giantarum. (all |xi| &lt;= 10^4 and |yi| &lt;= 10^4)</p>
</div>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For every test case, output one line. First output ¡°Case idx: ¡±, here  idx is the case number start from 1.Then output the area, rounded to 3  digits after the decimal point.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
