## Description

<div><p>A mathematician grabbed my computer as I was preparing this problem, deleted the statement, and changed the samples to fit his liking. The model solution and input/output format are still correct, but the samples are wrong. </p><p>I've partially fixed the problem so that when you submit, it will be tested against the correct version of the problem. However, I can't fix the samples below. As a computer scientist, can you solve the correct problem?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line of input contains a real number $x$ ($1 \leq x \leq 100$), given to exactly three decimal places.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output one real number&nbsp;¡ª the answer. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-4}$. Formally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $\frac{|a-b|}{\max(1,|b|)} \le 10^{-4}$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The only line of input contains a real number $x$ ($1 \leq x \leq 100$), given to exactly three decimal places.</p>

## Output

<p>Output one real number&nbsp;¡ª the answer. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-4}$. Formally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $\frac{|a-b|}{\max(1,|b|)} \le 10^{-4}$.</p>
