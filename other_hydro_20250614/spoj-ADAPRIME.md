<p>As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She grows many vegetables and trees and she wants to distinguish between them. For this purpose she bought a funny signs, which contains a few digits. The digits on the sign could be arbitrarily permuted (yet not added/removed). Ada likes prime numbers so she want the signs to be prime (and obviously distinct). Can you find the number of signs with prime number which could be obtained?</p>
<p>NOTE: Number can't have leading zero!</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input will contain <strong>1 ¡Ü T ¡Ü 10000</strong>, the number of test-cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next <strong>T</strong> lines will contain <strong>1 ¡Ü D ¡Ü 9</strong>, the number of digits on sign, followed by <strong>D</strong> digits <strong>0 ¡Ü d<sub>i</sub> ¡Ü 9</strong></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test-case, output the number of distinct primes which could be generated on given sign.</p>
