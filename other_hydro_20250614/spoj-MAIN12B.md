<p>Everyone loves Swampy. Swampy the Alligator lives under the city and yearns for a more human like existence. One day Swampy took part in a maths contest to show his supremacy over other his other alligator friends. The task required him to output the prime divisors of the lcm of n numbers a1,a2,..,an. Tired trying the problem, he turned to you for help. He believes that you can help him solve the problem.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single integer n. Next line contains n integers(space separated), a1,a2,..,an.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print Case #X: M where M is the number of prime divisors of lcm(a1,a2,..,an) and then M lines with the prime divisors in non-decreasing order.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

<strong>Output:</strong>
Case #1: 4
