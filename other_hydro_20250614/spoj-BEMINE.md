<p>Bermuda triangle is also known as Devil's triangle. Many people disappeared their with their ships/planes. Love triange is a triangle where when someone gets into it's uncertainity he disappears from himself. So bermuda love triangle is a triangle where there is uncertainity from each angle. Here is a story of Barmuda love triangle, where 3 vertex consists of 2 girls and a boy. Both of the girls love the boy and they are best friends also. The boy feels same for the both girls. So, its a Uncertainity-Uncertainity-Uncertainity triangle. As this can't go like this, they all want a solution. As students of CS department they found a solution.</p>
<p>The boy will be holding two infinite series in two hands, the first girl will pick a series, the 2nd girl gets the rest. Then the 2nd girl will tell a number x where both sequence will end. Now , whose result of the series will have a larger prime divisor will get the boy. If the result for both series is equal then they will all be friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the serieses, first girl's choice, second girl's choosen&nbsp; x, find who will win the boy, or they will be friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Series 1= 1+2+3+4+5+6+..................+x</p>
<p>Series 2= 0!+1*1!+2*2!+3*3!+4*4!+...............+x*x!</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer 0&lt;t&lt;10000 , number of testcases.</p>
<p>Next t lines contain 2 integer 1&lt;=s&lt;=2 and 2&lt;=x&lt;=10<sup>8</sup><sup>&nbsp;,</sup>Here s is the choice of the first girl, and x is the end of the series.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each testcase print "First" if the first girl wins the boy, print "Second" if the second one wins, "Friends" else.</p>
