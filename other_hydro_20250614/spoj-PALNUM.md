<p>A postive integer A is called a "palindrome number" if the reverse of the decimal representaion is the same as the original one. Ex. 13231 is a palindrome number, but 13333 is not.
<br><br>
Given a number A(1 &lt;= A &lt;= 1e18), find the number of pairs (a,b) such that a,b are both palindrome numbers, and the sum of a and b is A.
<br><br>
If A is 391, there are 6 ways:
8 + 383 = 383 + 8 = 391
88 + 303 = 303 + 88 = 391
99 + 292 = 292 + 99 = 391

</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first Line contains the number of test cases T &lt;= 10.
Each test case contains a number A.

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output the number of ways.

</p><h3>Example</h3>
