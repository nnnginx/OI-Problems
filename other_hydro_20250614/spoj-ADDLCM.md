<p>Mao is very good in mathematics, he likes to play with numbers and number theory is his favorite chapter. Once he decided to give a question to kalyu his friend . Now Kalyu is always busy in writing articles, as he likes maths but articles is his passion and source of income too, so he can¡¯t give much time solving that maths question, but he too don¡¯t want to hurt his friend, so help kalu in his problem ?</p>
<p>Given a,b such that a&lt;=b&nbsp; calculate the addition:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;LCM(a,b) + LCM(a+1,b) + .. + LCM(b,b), where LCM(a,b) denotes the Least Common Multiple of the integers a and b.</p>
<p><br>Since, output may be very large, take the mod 10^9+7</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line cosists of T=number of test&nbsp; cases, next T line will contain a and b</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each T lines, print the required output.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>T&lt;=100000</p>
<p>1 &lt;= a &lt;= b &lt;= 1000000</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br>3<br>1 6<br>10 15<br>41 90<br><br><strong>Output:<br></strong>66<br>675<br>139860</pre>
