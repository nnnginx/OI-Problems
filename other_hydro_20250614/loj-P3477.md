On a exterior planet, there are $m$ months in one year, and $d$ days in one month, as well as $w$ days in a week.

To distinguish different days of a week, humans use words like Monday and Tuesday to do that, while people on that planet use lowercase letters $a\ldots z$ to represent different days in a week.

Given that Year $1$, Month $1$, Day $1$ is represented by weekday `a`, your task is to find which weekday corresponds to Day $i$, Month $j$, Year $k$.

## Input Format

The input file consists of two lines. 

In the first line, there are three integers, respectively $d,~m,~w$ and three integers $i,~j,~k$ in the next line, respectively.

## Output Format

Output a letter representing the weekday of the given date.

```input1
30 12 7
18 1 2021
```

```output1
b
```

## Constraints

For all subtasks, it is guaranteed that $1\le d,m\le 100$, $1\le w\le 26$, $1\le i\le d$, $1\le j\le m$, $1\le k\le 10^9$.
