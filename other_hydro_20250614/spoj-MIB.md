<p>J, of the Men In Black,&nbsp; has been learning an alien language and has has a spelling test tomorrow.&nbsp; J, however, is bored of studying the nonsensical (and often unpronouncable) words.</p>
<p>Instead, he is seeing how many ways he can reorder his spelling list.&nbsp; After making all possible permutations of word on his list, he sorts the rearranged lists lexiographically (by the first word, then the second...).&nbsp; After the sort, in what position, with&nbsp; the lexiographically first list being in position 1, is his original spelling list?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line is the number of spelling lists (no more than 10).</p>
<p>For each spelling list, a line with the number of words (no more than 1000) is given, followed by the original list on the next line.</p>
<p>All words within a spelling list are unique.&nbsp; Each word is composed of the letters a-z, is fewer than 100 characters, and is followed by a single space.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>On separate lines, give the positions of the original lists.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
