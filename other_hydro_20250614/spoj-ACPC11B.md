<p>Did you try to ride a telepherique (cable car)? It is a lot of fun. Our company is trying to&nbsp;build a new telepherique line between two high mountains and you will be invited for a free&nbsp;ride. The trick to get your free ride is to help the company in building the telepherique line.</p>
<p>The company wants to build two platforms, one on each mountain. The line will extend&nbsp;between these two platforms. The suitable points for holding a platform in each mountain&nbsp;were determined, and the altitudes of these points were reported.</p>

<p>One of the talented engineers suggested that the company can save a lot of energy if the two&nbsp;stations have the same altitude or at least have altitudes which are as close to each other as&nbsp;possible. Your job is to select two points, one at each mountain, from those suitable points,&nbsp;so that the altitude difference between the two points is as little as possible.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. The first line of the input will be a&nbsp;single integer T , the number of test cases (1 ¡Ü T ¡Ü 100). Follows 2T lines containing the&nbsp;test cases, each on a pair of lines.</p>
<p>Each of the two lines in a case describe the altitudes of suitable points to build a platform&nbsp;on one mountain. Each line starts with an integer N , the number of reported altitudes&nbsp;(1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 1,000), followed by N integers, which represent the altitudes reported from this&nbsp;mountain. Any altitude value will be between 1 and 1,000,000, inclusive.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output, on a single line, a single number representing the minimum</p>
<p>altitude difference between two suitable platform points, one at each mountain.</p>
