<p>XerK had prepared his new problem with some sums of primes up to some bounds.<br>
His results are well here, but he forgot the bounds.<br>
Your task is to find which was the last prime in the sum.<br>
This problem is extremely simple, but you have to be extremely fast.
</p>


<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The lonely line of input contains an integer <strong><em>S</em></strong>.<br>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>You have to print the last prime <strong><em>P</em></strong> such that <strong><em>sum(prime from 2 to P) = S</em></strong>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre><strong>Input_1:</strong>
77
</pre>
<pre><strong>Output_1:</strong>
19
</pre>

<pre><strong>Input_2:</strong>
24739512092254535
</pre>
<pre><strong>Output_2:</strong>
999999937
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>The first sum was </p><pre>2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + <b>19</b> = 77</pre><p></p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<pre>0 &lt; P &lt;= 10^12
</pre>
<p>The challenge problem <a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/SUMPRIM1/">SUMPRIM1</a> is the reverse task.<br>
Time limit is set to allow some slow languages to finish in time, it could be hard.<br>
For your information, there's a total of 20 input files.<br>
;-) Have fun.</p>

<p>You may try before an excellent tutorial problem (<a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/TWINP2/">Twin Primes</a>) and make some speed experiments.<br>
You could take benefit too by working with <a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/PRINT/">PRINT</a>, another excellent tutorial problem.
