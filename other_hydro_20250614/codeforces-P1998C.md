## Note

<p>For the first test case, it is optimal to perform $5$ operations on both elements so $a = [8,8]$. So, the maximum score we can achieve is $\max(8 + \operatorname{median}[8], 8 + \operatorname{median}[8]) = 16$, as $c_1 = [a_2] = [8]$. It can be proven that you cannot get a better score.</p><p>For the second test case, you are not able to perform operations on any elements, so $a$ remains $[3,3,3]$. So, the maximum score we can achieve is $3 + \operatorname{median}[3, 3] = 6$, as $c_1 = [a_2, a_3] = [3, 3]$. It can be proven that you cannot get a better score.</p>
