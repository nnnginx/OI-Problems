<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feluda likes numbers very much but hates prime numbers too much. For a fixed n, you gave Feluda eqution x^2&nbsp; + y^2 + n = (x + y) ^ 2. Now you only want positive integral solution of x and y. Feluda being an intelligent person gave you all the pairs of (x, y) but he missed the pairs which had x as a prime number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all the solution that Feluda gave you, we want you to just print those values in the following format: first print the number of such x's, then the possible values x sorted in increasing order in a line seperated by single space. If no such numbers exist, then print a 0 in the line.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>T : number of test cases (T &lt;= 100)<br>For next T lines each line contain n (n &lt;= 10^12)</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For every test case print as stated in the problem statement.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
