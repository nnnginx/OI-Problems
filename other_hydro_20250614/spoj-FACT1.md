<p>This is a problem to test the robustness of your Integer Factorization algorithm.</p>
<p>
Given some integers, you need to factor them into product of prime numbers.
</p>
<p>
The largest integer given in the input file has 20 digits.
<a href="/problems/FACT2">FACT2</a> is a harder version of this problem (the numbers are larger).
</p>
<p>You may need to use a general factorization algorithm since no special numbers (e.g. Fermat numbers) are considered when designing the input data.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There are several numbers given, each one in a line. </p>
<p>The input ends with a number 0.</p>
<p>The number of test cases is about 10.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each number, print in a line the factorization of it. See examples below for the output format.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
