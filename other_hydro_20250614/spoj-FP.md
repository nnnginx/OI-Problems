<p><br>Your task is writing a program to help find P the password for Bom’s email.</p>
<p><br>Input<br>The first line contains a positive integer T as the number of test cases in the input file. The<br>following lines describe information of each test case including:<br>• One line containing two positive integers n and k,<br>• n following lines are n favorite numbers.</p>
<p><br>Output<br>The output file contains T lines; each line is the solution of the corresponding test case that is<br>either password P or -1 in case of not finding a feasible number.</p>
<p><br>Limits<br>T &lt;= 30<br>1 &lt;= k &lt;= n &lt;= 100<br>1 &lt;= all favorite numbers &lt;= 10^6</p>
<p><br>Sample input<br>2<br>3 2<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>5 2<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5</p>
