## Description

<div><p> </p><p>You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):</p><ul> <li> Choose an index $i$ ($1\le i\le n$). Multiply $a_i$ by $-1$ (i.e., update $a_i := -a_i$). </li></ul><p>Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make the element at index $1$ become the median of the array after doing the above operation any number of times. Note that operations can be applied to index $1$ as well, meaning the median can be either the original value of $a_1$ or its negation.</p><p>The median of an array $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$ is defined as the $\left\lceil \frac{m}{2} \right\rceil$-th$^{\text{∗}}$ smallest element of array $b$. For example, the median of the array $[3, 1, 2]$ is $2$, while the median of the array $[10, 1, 8, 3]$ is $3$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the absolute value of the elements of $a$ are distinct. Formally, there are no pairs of indices $1\le i &lt; j\le n$ where $|a_i| = |a_j|$.</p><div class="statement-footnote"><p>$^{\text{∗}}$$\lceil x \rceil$ is the ceiling function which returns the least integer greater than or equal to $x$.</p></div></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 10^5$)&nbsp;— the length of the array $a$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($|a_i|\le 10^6$, $|a_i|\neq |a_j|$)&nbsp;— the elements of the array $a$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. </p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each testcase, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" if it is possible to make the element at index $1$ become the median of the array, and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" otherwise.</p><p>You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yEs</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yes</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">Yes</span>", and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" will be recognized as positive responses.</p></div>

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 10^5$)&nbsp;— the length of the array $a$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($|a_i|\le 10^6$, $|a_i|\neq |a_j|$)&nbsp;— the elements of the array $a$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. </p>

## Output

<p>For each testcase, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" if it is possible to make the element at index $1$ become the median of the array, and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" otherwise.</p><p>You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yEs</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yes</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">Yes</span>", and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" will be recognized as positive responses.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, $a_1 = 2$ is already the median of the array $a = [2, 3, 1]$, so no operation is required.</p><p>In the second test case, we can do two operations: one on index $2$, and one on index $5$. The array becomes $[1, -2, 3, 4, -5]$, which has a median of $1$.</p><p>In the third test case, if you do an operation on index $1$, the array will become $[-4, 2, 0, -5]$, which has a median of $-4$.</p><p>In the fourth test case, it can be proven that no sequence of operations can make the median of the array become $5$ or $-5$.</p>
