<p>Sacchi and Maurya are String lovers. They love to solve problems on strings. So our born-talented Priyun decided to ask them a problem on strings. He gave them a string of size S which consists of only small English letters. According to Priyun some of the alphabets are ¡°Nice¡± and rest all are ¡°Eww¡±. Now Priyun has a tolerance level of X ¡°Eww¡±. <br> Priyun wants to know the distinct substrings of the given string which he can tolerate.<br> Even Sacchi and Maurya is finding it difficult to solve. So help them.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input file consists of several cases T (1&lt;=T&lt;=10).<br> The first line of each test case consists of a string S, [Size of S is &lt;=2000].<br> S consists of only lowercase English Letters.<br> Next line contains the number P[0&lt;=P&lt;=26], the number of ¡°Nice¡± Alphabets.<br> Next P lines contains an Alphabet that is Nice. All the P characters are distinct and it is between [a,z].<br> Next line contains an Integer X i.e. the tolerance level of Priyun.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print a single integer for each testcase i.e &nbsp;the number of distinct substrings that Priyun can tolerate.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
