## Description

**Translated from Chinese version of [ROIR 2021](http://neerc.ifmo.ru/school/archive/2020-2021.html) Day1 T4 [§¡§ß§ä§Ö§ß§ß§Ñ](http://neerc.ifmo.ru/school/archive/2020-2021/ru-olymp-regional-2021-day1.pdf) on this website.**

There are $n$ ropes, among which the $i$-th rope is $s_i$ centimeter long. Besides, $m_i$ nodes are on that rope, and the $j$-th node is $p_{i,~j}$ centimeter away from the leftmost side of the rope.

Your task is to find a solution to connect ropes from left to right satisfying that all distances between adjacent nodes equals after connecting $q_i$-th and $q_{i+1}$-th ropes, whereas $q$ represents the solution and would obviously be a permutation of $1\sim n$.

Output `No` if such solution does not exist.

## Input Format

The first line will be an integer $n$.

In the following $2n$ lines:

- The $(2i)$-th line would be two integers, $m_i$ and $s_i$
- The $(2i+1)$-th line would be $m_i$ integers, respectively $p_{i,j}$

Note that the value of $i$ above satisfies $1\le i\le n$.


## Output Format

If the solution could be found, output `Yes` in the first line and $n$ integers $q_i$ in the following line. 

Otherwise, output `No`.

## Constraints

It is guaranteed that for all subtasks, there are $1\le n\le 10^5$, $1\le m_i\le 10^5$, $0\le s_i\le 10^9$, $0\le p_{i,1}<p_{i,2}<\cdots<p_{i,m_i}\le s_i$, $\sum m_i\le 10^5$.
