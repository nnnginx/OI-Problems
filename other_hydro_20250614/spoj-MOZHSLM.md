<p>Mozahid &amp; Sharmeen loves each other &amp; spend a lots of time together. One day they found a string which contains only lowercase english letters. As Mozahid loves Sharmeen very much he likes all ¡®s¡¯ in the string. On the other hand as Sharmeen loves Mozahid very much she likes all the ¡®m¡¯ in the string. Sharmeen always want to stay on both sides(left &amp; right) of Mozahid so that no other girl can take him away from her :P. So, this time Mozahid gives her a task. Mozahid told her, if she can tell him how many different subsequence of ¡®<strong>sms</strong>¡¯ exist in that string, he will ensure her that no girl will take him away from her. As Sharmeen is not a programmer, she needs your help to perform this task. Can you do this for her?</p>
