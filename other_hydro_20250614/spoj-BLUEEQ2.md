<p>Today Mary's math homework is to solve an equation.</p>
<p><img src="../../../content/john_jones:blueeq2a.bmp" alt=""></p>
<p>She knows all ki and pi, and 1&lt;=xi&lt;=M. All xi must be integers. She must work out the number of different solutions of this equation this day.Can you give her a hand?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There is a single integer T in the very first line of the input denoted the number of tests.T blocks follow.</p>
<p>For each test case:</p>
<p>The first line contains a single integer n(n&lt;=6).The second line contains a single integer m(m&lt;=150).n lines follow,each contains two space-separated integers ki and pi, i=1,2,...,n. All pi are positive.</p>
