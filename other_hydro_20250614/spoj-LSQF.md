<p>Given a string x, the string obtained by concatenating x to itself is sometimes called the square of x. <br><br>Given a string s, output the longest string x such that its square is a substring of s. If you find more than one solution, output the lexicographically smallest.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a string s (consisting only of lowercase letters of the english alphabet). The length of s is less than or equal to 10<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>To the first line of output print the length of the string x.<br> To the second line print the string x.</p>
<p>Such a string will always exist in the test data.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
abcabc<br><strong><br>Output:</strong>
3<br>abc</pre>
