Fiona has always loved poetry, and recently she discovered a fascinating poetical form. Tautograms are a special case&nbsp;alliteration, which is the occurrence of the same letter at the&nbsp;beginning of adjacent words. In particular, a sentence is a&nbsp;tautogram if all of its words start&nbsp;with the same letter.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
For instance, the following sentences are tautograms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flowers Flourish from France</li>
  <li>Sam Simmonds speaks softly</li>
  <li>Peter pIckEd pePPers</li>
  <li>truly tautograms triumph</li>
</ul>
<p>Fiona wants to dazzle her boyfriend with a romantic letter full of this kind of sentences. Please&nbsp;help Fiona to check if each&nbsp;sentence she wrote down is a tautogram or not.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
Each test case is given in a single line that contains a sentence. A sentence consists of&nbsp;a sequence of at most 50 words separated by single spaces. A word is a sequence of&nbsp;at most 20 contiguous uppercase and lowercase letters from the English alphabet. A&nbsp;word contains at least one letter&nbsp;and a sentence contains at least one word.
</p>
<p>
The last test case is followed by a line containing only a single character ¡®<tt>*</tt>¡¯ (asterisk).
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case output a single line containing an uppercase ¡®<tt>Y</tt>¡¯ if the sentence is a tautogram, or an uppercase ¡®<tt>N</tt>¡¯ otherwise.
