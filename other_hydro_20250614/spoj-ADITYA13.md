<p>Having cleared the ACM ICPC online round you receive a job offer of teaching JAVA programming to High School Students of Byteland. You gladly take the job offer and after a few days of teaching you give the students a program to write. You ask them to write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">FIZZBUZZ</a> program. They are either too smart or too lazy. They argue that it is too difficult and callenge you to do better than that without using any english alphabets. You consult senior programmer <a href="../../../users/cyclops/">Mitch</a> who suggests you a way out of the problem. "Do it in BF," he says. <a href="../../../users/tjandra/">Tjandra</a> suggests you do it in Whitespace.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Two space separated one digit integers A and B.Then a newline.Then a strings C of maximum length 5 followed by a newline. Then another string D of max length 5 followed by a newline. It is guaranteed that gcd(A,B)&lt;A and gcd(A,B)&lt;B. Also the strings comprise only alphanumeric characters</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For all numbers in the set [1,99] print C if the number is divisible by A, print D if divisible by D, print C concat D if divisible by both and the number (with preceding zeroes if required) if it divisible by neither A nor B.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2 3</pre>
<pre>Happy</pre>
<pre>2013

<strong>Output:</strong>
01
</pre>
<pre>Happy</pre>
<pre>2013</pre>
<pre>Happy</pre>
<pre>05</pre>
<pre>Happy2013</pre>
<pre>07</pre>
<pre>..........and you get the idea</pre>
<pre><strong>Wishing all of you a HAPPY NEW YEAR 2013......:)</strong></pre>
