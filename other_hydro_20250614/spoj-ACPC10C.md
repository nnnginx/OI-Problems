<p>As you most probably know, any boolean expression can be expressed in either a disjunctive normal form or a conjunctive normal form. In a disjunctive normal form, a boolean expression is written as a disjunct (logical or) of one-or more sub-expressions where each of these sub-expressions is written in a conjunctive normal form. Similarly, an expression written in a conjunctive normal form is a conjunct (logical and) of sub-expressions each written in a disjunctive normal form.</p>

<p><br>An AND/OR tree is a tree-like graphical-representation of boolean ex- pressions written as either conjunctive- or disjunctive-normal form. Since the sub-expressions of a normalized form alternate in being either disjunctive or conjunctive forms, you¡¯d expect the sub-trees on an AND/OR tree to alternate in being AND- or OR- trees depending on the sub-tree¡¯s depth-level. The example upwards illustrates this observation for the boolean expression (A (B C)) (D E) where the trees in the 1st (top-most) and 3rd levels are AND-trees.<br>Write a program that evaluates a given and/or tree.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each test case is specified on exactly one line (which is no longer than 32,000 characters) of the form:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( E1 E2 . . . En )<br>where n &gt; 0 and Ei is either T for true, F for false, or a sub-expression using the same format.<br>The trees at the deepest level are AND-trees. The last test case is followed by a dummy line made of ().</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print the following line:<br>k. E<br>Where k is the test case number (starting at one,) and E is either true or false depending on the value of the expression in that test case.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br>((F(TF))(TF))<br>(TFT)<br>((TFT)T)<br>()<br><br><strong>Output:</strong><br>1. false<br>2. false<br>3. true</pre>
