<p>Define F(n,k) = Sum of kth powers of all divisors of n<br> So for example F(6,2) = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2 = 50<br> <br> Define further G(a,b,k) as : Sum of F(j,k) where j varies from a to b both inclusive<br> <br> Your task is to find G(a,b,k) given a,b &amp; k.<br> As values of G can get very large , you only need to output the value of G(a,b,k) modulo 10^9+7.<br> <br> <strong>Input Format:</strong></p>
<p><br>First line of input file contains a single integer T - denoting the number of test cases.<br>The  follow description of T test cases. Each test case occupies exactly one  line which contains three space separated integers a,b &amp; k.<br><br><strong>Output Format:</strong></p>
<p><br>Output your result for each test case in a new line.</p>
<p><br><strong>Sample Input File:</strong><br><br>2<br>2 2 1<br>1 3 2<br><br><strong>Sample Output File:</strong><br><br>3<br>16<br><br><br><strong>Description of sample output:</strong><br><br>In case 1, we are to find sum of divisors of 2. which is nothing but 1+2=3.<br>In  case 2, we are to find sum of squares of divisors of 1 2 &amp; 3. So  for 1 sum is = 1. For 2 sum is = 1^2+ 2^2= 5. For 3 sum is = 1^2 +  3^2=10.<br>So ans is 16.<br><strong><br> Constraints :</strong></p>
