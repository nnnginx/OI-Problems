<p>You are given a set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}. Your task is simple. You have to calculate the number of ways of selecting non empty&nbsp;subsets A and B such that A is not a subset of B and B is not a subset of A. Since answer can be large output the result mod 10^9 + 7.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of input contains single integer t denoting number of test cases.</p>
<p>Next t lines contain a single integer n.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output answer to problem by taking mod with 10^9 + 7.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100000</p>
<p>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000000</p>
