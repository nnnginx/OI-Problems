<p><br>Farmer John is going to build a new rectangular barn. But the 4 corners of &nbsp;<br>the barn mustn't be on soft soil. He examined the ground and found that &nbsp;<br>there are only N (4 &lt;= N &lt;= 1,000) appropriate points for the corners. He <br>wants to know the number of possible ways to build the new barn. <br>&nbsp;<br>Given the points, help him find the answer. <br>&nbsp;<br>INPUT FORMAT: <br>&nbsp;<br>Input exactly contains 10 test cases each of them as follows: <br>&nbsp;<br>* Line 1: A single integer, N. <br>&nbsp;<br>* Lines 2..N+1: Each line has two space-separated integers x, y which <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are the coordinates&nbsp; of a point. The magnitude of the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coordinates is not more than 16,000. All points will be <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distinct. <br>&nbsp;<br>SAMPLE INPUT : <br>&nbsp;<br>8 <br>1 2 <br>1 -2 <br>2 1 <br>2 -1 <br>-1 2 <br>-1 -2 <br>-2 1 <br>-2 -1 <br>&nbsp;<br>[and 9 more Test cases ....] <br>&nbsp;<br>OUTPUT FORMAT: <br>&nbsp;<br>For each Test case print one line contains: <br>&nbsp;<br>* The number of possible ways to build the new barn. <br>&nbsp;<br>SAMPLE OUTPUT : <br>&nbsp;<br>6 <br>&nbsp;<br>[and 9 more Test cases ....] <br>&nbsp;<br>OUTPUT DETAILS: <br>&nbsp;<br>the answers are: {1,2,6,5}, {1,3,6,8}, {1,4,6,7}, {2,3,5,8}, {2,4,5,7}, <br>{3,4,8,7}</p>
