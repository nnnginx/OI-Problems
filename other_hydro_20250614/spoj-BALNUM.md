<p>Balanced numbers have been used by mathematicians for centuries. A positive integer is considered a balanced number if:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every <strong>even </strong>digit appears an <strong>odd </strong>number of times in its decimal representation</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every <strong>odd </strong>digit appears an <strong>even </strong>number of times in its decimal representation</p>
<p>For example, 77, 211, 6222 and 112334445555677 are balanced numbers while 351, 21, and 662 are not.</p>
<p>Given an interval [A, B], your task is to find the amount of balanced numbers in [A, B] where both <strong>A and B are included.</strong></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases.</p>
<p>A test case consists of two numbers A and B separated by a single space representing the interval. You may assume that 1 &lt;= A &lt;= B &lt;= 10<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, you need to write a number in a single line: the amount of balanced numbers in the corresponding interval</p>
