<p>So , it was winter and Me and 8 of my friends decided to plan a trip to GOA . Since the Bars ans Clubs are too Expensive out there , we decided to pool money together for our whole trip expenses . Now since every group has some internal politics going on , same aplies to our group also :P . 2 Members that are having a cold war between them won't go to the trip if the other one is going . But Since we want to enjoy a lavish party , we want to maximize the pooled money . So , for this task I've chosen my marwari friend&nbsp;Mohit to solve this problem &nbsp;( He's good at money matters )&nbsp; . Your task is to help&nbsp;Mohit achieve the maximum pooled money&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The next P lines will contain 2 numbers seperated by a space showing the members having a cold war&nbsp; . Numbers used to denote members will be ( 1-8 ) for each 8 members&nbsp;.</p>
