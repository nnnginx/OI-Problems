<p align="justify">The&nbsp;infamous Bytelandian Bit-eating Fanatic Organisation (BBFO for short)&nbsp;plans to launch an 
	all-out&nbsp;denial-of-service attack on&nbsp;the Bytelandian McDecimal's fast food 
	network by blocking the entrance to every restaurant with a camel (the 
	purpose being to rid&nbsp;the Organisation&nbsp;of unhealthy competition, 
	obviously). In a sly and perfidious move, the head cryptographer 
	of&nbsp;BBFO&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;disclose the date and time of 
	the&nbsp;planned attack to the management of McDecimal's, but in encrypted form 
	(ha ha). He calculated the number of seconds from midnight 1970.01.01 GMT to 
	the moment of attack, squared it, divided it by 4000000007 and sent the 
	remainder by e-mail to McDecimal's. This made the original date impossible to 
	decode.</p>
<p align="justify">Or did it?</p>

<p align="justify">You work as the head algorthimist at McDecimal's HQ and know 
	nothing of what is&nbsp;happening in Byteland.&nbsp;Things are not going well. You 
	are&nbsp;playing a quiet game of&nbsp;hearts against your computer&nbsp;and 
	wondering why&nbsp;on earth Management are considering making you redundant. 
	Suddenly, the CEO&nbsp;bursts into your office, saying:</p>
<p align="justify">- Look here, young man[lady]! I have this number&nbsp;and&nbsp;those 
	guys&nbsp;claim it is supposed to be some date. I am giving you one second to 
	tell me what it all means!</p>
<p align="justify">I am afraid you have no choice. You can't ask any further 
	questions.<br>You just have to answer, now.</p>
