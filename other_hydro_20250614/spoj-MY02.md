<pre><br><span style="white-space: normal;">All you have to do is implement the following algorithm ,which is a very popular compression technique.<br><br> 1.You are given an input string A. (For eg. ababc )<br><br> 2.Find all the rotations of A (In this case, it is ababc,babca,abcab,bcaba,cabab)<br><br> •	Now sort them (After sorting, we have ababc,abcab,babca,bcaba,cabab)<br> •	Then arrange them as follows: <br>	ababc <br>	abcab <br>	babca 	<br>bcaba <br>	cabab <br>•	Now pick out the last column. It is ‘cbaab’. It is the result of this algorithm<br>•	Also observe that the 1st row has the original string.(Use 1 indexing) <br><br> Now, for this problem, you are given the output and the row number that has the original string.<br> For the above example , it is ‘cbaab’ and 1. <br> Given these 2 parameters, you just need to decode it. (ie.,find the original string.) <br><br> <strong>
<br>Input:</strong><br><br> Each test case has 2 lines. <br>
1st line – An integer R that represents the row that contains the original string.<br>
 2nd line - A string that represents the output of the above algorithm.  (Length of string &lt;=2000) (All characters are lower case).<br> The input is terminated with R=-1.<br> <br> <strong>Output:</strong><br><br> The original string. <br><br> <strong>Sample Input:<br><br></strong> 1 <br>cbaab <br>3 <br>mnoag<br> -1 <strong><br><br>Sample Output:<br><br></strong> ababc<br> mango</span></pre>
