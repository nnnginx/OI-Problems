## Description

<div><pre class="verbatim">There was once young lass called Mary,  
Whose jokes were occasionally scary.  
On this April's Fool  
Fixed limerick rules  
Allowed her to trip the unwary.

Can she fill all the lines
To work at all times?
On juggling the words
Right around two-thirds
She nearly ran out of rhymes.
