<p>Ajoy has got some spare time today. He is using this spare time to think of a particular kind of number.</p>

<p>He calls it ¡®Peculiar Number¡¯.</p>

<p>A peculiar number is define by three integers A, B and C and has the following characteristics.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1)&nbsp;If a number is a multiple of A but not a multiple of B then it is a peculiar number.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2) If a number is a multiple of both A and B then it will be a peculiar number only if it is also a multiple of number C. Otherwise it is not a peculiar number.</p>

<p>Now, Ajoy is trying to find the Nth peculiar number for a fixed A, B and C.</p>

<p>But Ajoy does not have all day. So he needs your help to solve the problem.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of the input contains four integers A, B, C &nbsp;and M where (1 &lt;= A, B, C &lt;= 10<sup>3</sup>) and (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>) contraints hold.</p>

<p>M denotes the number of queries.</p>

<p>Each of the next M line contains an integer N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup>).</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each query, print the Nth peculiar number.</p>
