<p>Welcome To ICPC! ICPC is a programming competition in which N teams participate every year. Out of N teams, K number of teams has been selected from our college. You know what? K is always a prime number. Coincidence! Before going to ICPC, we want to calculate our expected overall score of our college.</p>
<p>Expected Overall score is defined as expected median value of our college team¡¯s ranks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the ranks are distinct. Team¡¯s rank value always lies between 1 to N.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line consists of T, the number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each of the next T lines contains 2 space separated integers N and K.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output T lines each line containing expected overall score of our college. You should output at least 6 digits after decimal.</p>
