## Description

<div><p>Surely, you have seen problems which require you to output the answer modulo $10^9+7$, $10^9+9$, or $998244353$. But have you ever seen a problem where you have to print the answer modulo $3$?</p><p>You are given a functional graph consisting of $n$ vertices, numbered from $1$ to $n$. It is a directed graph, in which each vertex has exactly one outgoing arc. The graph is given as the array $g_1, g_2, \dots, g_n$, where $g_i$ means that there is an arc that goes from $i$ to $g_i$. For some vertices, the outgoing arcs might be self-loops.</p><p>Initially, all vertices of the graph are colored in color $1$. You can perform the following operation: select a vertex and a color from $1$ to $k$, and then color this vertex and all vertices that are reachable from it. You can perform this operation any number of times (even zero).</p><p>You should process $q$ queries. The query is described by three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$. For each query, you should: </p><ul> <li> assign $g_x := y$; </li><li> then calculate the number of different graph colorings for the given value of $k$ (two colorings are different if there exists at least one vertex that is colored in different colors in these two colorings); since the answer can be very large, print it <span class="tex-font-style-bf">modulo $3$</span>. </li></ul><p>Note that in every query, the initial coloring of the graph is reset (all vertices initially have color $1$ in each query).</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $g_1, g_2, \dots, g_n$ ($1 \le g_i \le n$).</p><p>The $q$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains three integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and $k_i$ ($1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$; $1 \le k_i \le 10^9$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each query, print a single integer&nbsp;�� the number of different graph colorings for the given value of $k$, taken modulo $3$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $g_1, g_2, \dots, g_n$ ($1 \le g_i \le n$).</p><p>The $q$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains three integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and $k_i$ ($1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$; $1 \le k_i \le 10^9$).</p>

## Output

<p>For each query, print a single integer&nbsp;�� the number of different graph colorings for the given value of $k$, taken modulo $3$.</p>
