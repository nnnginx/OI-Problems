<p>We define consecutive sequence as a sequence of integer numbers {n, n+1, n+2, ..., n+m}. For each given positive integer N&nbsp;¡Ü&nbsp;10<sup>7</sup> calculate number of such sequences which sum is equal to N.

</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input file consists of multiple lines (about 10<sup>3</sup> in the first data set and 10<sup>5</sup> in the second), each line contains integer N. The input is terminated with N = 0, which should not be processed.

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>Expected number in each line

</p><h3>Example</h3>
