## Description

<div><p>You are given a rooted tree, consisting of $n$ vertices. The vertices in the tree are numbered from $1$ to $n$, and the root is the vertex $1$. Let $d_x$ be the distance (the number of edges on the shortest path) from the root to the vertex $x$.</p><p>There is a chip that is initially placed at the root. You can perform the following operation as many times as you want (possibly zero):</p><ul> <li> move the chip from the current vertex $v$ to a vertex $u$ such that $d_u = d_v + 1$. If $v$ is the root, you can choose any vertex $u$ meeting this constraint; however, if $v$ is not the root, $u$ should not be a neighbor of $v$ (there should be no edge connecting $v$ and $u$). </li></ul><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="./36048/file/217wbuAq.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>For example, in the tree above, the following chip moves are possible: $1 \rightarrow 2$, $1 \rightarrow 5$, $2 \rightarrow 7$, $5 \rightarrow 3$, $5 \rightarrow 4$, $3 \rightarrow 6$, $7 \rightarrow 6$.</p><p>A sequence of vertices is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">valid</span> if you can move the chip in such a way that it visits all vertices from the sequence (and only them), in the order they are given in the sequence.</p><p>Your task is to calculate the number of valid vertex sequences.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;！ the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$).</p><p>The second line contains $n-1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i &lt; i$), where $p_i$ is the parent of the $i$-th vertex in the tree. Vertex $1$ is the root.</p><p>Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.</p>
