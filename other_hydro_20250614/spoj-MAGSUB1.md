<p>Lucifer MorningStar is interested in deepest desires of Zing. Being a programmer Zing said he has a desire of knowing number of magical substrings in a string. A substring of string S is said to be magical if it contains atleast one magical character (A character is magical if its value is prime, and we assign values to characters as:&nbsp; A is assigned 1 , B is assigned 2......Z is assigned 26). So you have to calculate total number of magical substrings for S in order to help Lucifer who is absolutely newbie in programming, so that he does not disappoint Zing.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains number of test cases. ( 1&lt;=T&lt;=10).</p>
<p>For each case input will contain two lines.</p>
<p>First line contains length of string N ( 1&lt;=N&lt;=10^5).</p>
<p>Second line will contain a string S of length N. (String will only contain uppercase letters.)</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single integer denoting number of magical substrings of S in new line.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong></pre>
<pre>1</pre>
<pre>3</pre>
<pre>ABC</pre>
<pre><strong>Output:</strong>
5</pre>
