<p>The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) &nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \leq n, q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$) &nbsp;— the length of $a$ and the number of queries.</p><p>The following line contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq n$). </p><p>The following $q$ lines contain two integers $i$ and $x$, denoting the query that replaces $a_i$ with $x$ ($1 \leq i, x \leq n$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output the answer to all queries on a single new line, separated by a space.</p>
