<h3>  Please, go first</h3>

<p>You are currently on a skiing trip with a group of friends. In general, it is going well: you enjoy the skiing during the day and, of course, the apr¨¨s-skiing during the night. However, there is one nuisance: the skiing lift. As always, it is too small, and can only serve one person every 5 seconds. To make matters worse, you and your friends generally don¡¯t arrive simultaneously at the lift, which means that you spend time waiting at the bottom of the mountain for the lift and at the top again for your friends. <!--l. 12--></p>
<p>The waiting at the top is especially inefficient. In fact, you realize that if your friends haven¡¯t arrived yet, you might as well let other people pass you in the queue. For you, it makes no difference, since otherwise you¡¯d be waiting at the top. On the other hand, your actions might save them time if their friends have already arrived and are currently waiting for them at the top. <!--l. 19--></p>
<p>You are wondering how much time would be saved if everybody adopts this nice attitude. You have carefully observed the queue for a while and noticed which persons form groups of friends. Suppose someone lets another pass if doing this doesn¡¯t change his own total waiting time, but saves time for the other person. Do this over and over again until it can¡¯t be done anymore. How much time will this save, in total? <!--l. 26--></p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<!--l. 27-->
<p>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul>
<li>one line with an integer <em>n </em>(1 ¡Ü <em>n </em>¡Ü 25<span style="margin-left:0.3em">&nbsp;000): the number of people in the line for the       lift. </span></li>
<li>one  line  with  <em>n </em>alphanumeric  characters  (uppercase  and  lowercase  letters  and       numbers): the queue. The first person in this line corresponds to the person at the       head of the queue. Equal characters correspond to persons from the same group of       friends.</li>
</ul>
<!--l. 39-->

<h4>Output</h4>
<!--l. 40-->
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul>
<li>one line with an integer: the time saved, in seconds.</li>
</ul>
