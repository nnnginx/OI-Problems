<p>Given a positive odd integer K and two positive integers low and high, determine how many integers between low and high contain exactly K divisors.

</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains a positive integer C (0 &lt; C &lt; 100,000), the number of test cases to follow. Each case consists of a line containing three integers: K, low, and high (1 &lt; K &lt; 10000, 0 &lt; low ¡Ü high &lt; 10^10). K will always be an odd integer.

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output for each case consists of one line: the number of integers between low and high, inclusive, that contain exactly K divisors.
