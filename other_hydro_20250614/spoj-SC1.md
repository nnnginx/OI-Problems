<h3>Background</h3>
<p>You may play the game Starcraft I first before you do this problem ^_^. </p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Suppose you are using Protoss. At the beginning of the game, you have <i>n</i> probes, a nexus and almost unlimited number of pylons. You can build a probe in the nexus per 3 Starcraft time units(STs), and this will cost you <i>z</i> units of minerals. A probe can gather <i>x</i> units of minerals or <i>y</i> units of gas per ST. What's the minimum time to get <i>A</i> units of minerals and <i>B</i> units of gas, if you build probes at nexus only and don't build any buildings?</p>
<p>Assume that in the current map there are almost unlimited mineral fields and unlimited vespene geysers, and on each vespene geyser, a Protoss Assimilator has been built successfully.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Multiple test cases, the number of them is given in the very first line.</p>
<p>Each test case contains one line with 6 positive integers <i>n</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> separated by one space. All numbers in the input file will be less than 21. </p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output one line, which contains a single integer, the minimum time in ST.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Input</b>:
1
1 2 3 4 5 6

<b>Output:</b>
