<p>Tim defines an integer as "Strictly not a Prime", if no subsequence(considering the integer as a string of digits) of the integer is a prime. He needs your help in finding how many such integers are present between two given integers A and B(including A and B).</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains an integer T(1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100000) which denotes the total number test cases. Each test case consists of two integers A and B (1 &lt;= A, B &lt;= 100000) on a single line.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print the total count of integers which are "Strictly not a prime" between A and B(including A and B) as per tim.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

2</pre>
<pre>3 6</pre>
<pre>7 10</pre>
<pre><strong>Output:</strong>
