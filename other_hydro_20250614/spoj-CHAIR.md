<p>N chairs are placed in a circle.</p>
<p>There will be K attendants to&nbsp;a very important&nbsp;meeting.</p>
<p>However, the attendants do not like each other, so they&nbsp;do not want to sit beside each other in the meeting.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;the host of this&nbsp;important meeting, you want to find out how many ways there are&nbsp;to choose K chairs such that none of them&nbsp;are adjacent to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input is an integer N (4&lt;=N&lt;=1000), which denotes the number of chairs.</p>
<p>The next line is an integer K (1&lt;=K&lt;=N), which denotes the number of attendants to the meeting.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output the total number of ways to choose K chairs from N chairs such that none of the chairs&nbsp;are adjacent.</p>
<p>Since the answer can get very large, output the answer modulo 1,000,000,003.</p>
