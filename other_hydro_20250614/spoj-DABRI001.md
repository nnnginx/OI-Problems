<p>The big Noel is a guy full of habits. This year he put all of his  reindeer in a row and decided to select the most of them, following a  few rules.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Reindeer can not be changed in order, ie a reindeer that is in position <strong>i</strong> in the original row should appear before the reindeer <strong>j</strong> in the chosen list, where <strong>i</strong> &lt; <strong>j</strong>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;- Reindeer of two adjacent positions in the final sequence must differ exactly by 1 (right-left=1) unit in their heights.</p>
<p>If that was not enough, Noel realized that this sequence had few  reindeer. So she decided to include a new reindeer in the original row.  Taking into account that this new reindeer can be inserted in any  position and he will always choose a reindeer with the best possible  height.</p>
<p>After making the task a little difficult, Noel ended up getting  confused and is asking for your help to find out how many reindeer can  be selected taking into account the rules imposed.</p>
