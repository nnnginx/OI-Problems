<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">cactus graph</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Your task in this problem is to count the number of ways you can convert a cactus graph to a&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">spanning tree.</span></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first line of input will be the number of test cases. Each test case will start with a two numbers N and E where N is the number of vertices of the cactus graph, vertices are numbered from 1 to N, 3 &lt;= N &lt;= 81 and E is the number of edges in the graph, 2 &lt;= E &lt;= 120. The next E lines each one will have two numbers v and w and that means there is an edge between vertix v and w.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each test case print ¡°Case C: X¡± without quotes where C is the case number starting with 1 and X is the number of ways you can convert the given cactus graph to a spanning tree.</p>
