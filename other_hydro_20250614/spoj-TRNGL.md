<p>Chayanika loves Mathematics. She is learning a new chapter geometry. While reading the chapter a question came in her mind. Given a convex polygon of n sides. In how many ways she can break it into triangles, by cutting it with (n-3) non-adjacent diagonals and the diagonals do not intersect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of the input will be an integer t (1&lt;=t&lt;=100000) which is the no of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (3&lt;=n&lt;=1000) which is the size of the polygon.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output the no of ways %100007.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2<br>3<br>5<br><br>&nbsp;<strong>Output:</strong>
1<br>5</pre>
