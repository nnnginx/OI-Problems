<p><span style="font-size: small;">Euclid may have been the first to prove that there are infinitely many primes. Let's walk through his proof, as even today, it's regarded as an excellent model of reasoning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Let us assume the converse, that there only a finite number of primes:</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;">p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub></span>.<span style="font-size: small;"> Let </span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>m</strong> = 1 + <sub>i=1</sub></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: large;">¦°<span style="font-size: small;"><sup>n&nbsp;</sup></span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;">p<span style="font-size: small;"><sub>i,</sub> i.e.</span><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: small;">the product of all of these primes plus one. Since this number is bigger than any of the primes on our list, m must be composite. Therefore, some prime must divide it. But which prime? In fact, m leaves a reminder of 1 when divided by any prime p<sub>i</sub>, for 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n. Thus, p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub> cannot be the complete list of primes, because if so m must also be a prime. Since this contradicts the assumption it means there cannot exist such a complete list of primes; therefore the number of primes must be infinite!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: small;">Your mathematician friend Wannabe_Fermat has come up with a conjecture which he keeps telling to anyone who is willing to lend an ear: "The number <strong>m</strong> that we come up with when multiplying any <strong>n</strong> distinct prime numbers and adding 1 to this result is also a prime". You as Wannabe_Zuckerburg, are becoming jealous as your friend's conjecture is gaining popularity and decide to come up with a program that finds counter-examples to shut him up forever.</span></span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: small;">Input</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">The first line contains T, the number of test-cases. Each test-case consists of two lines, the first line containing the number <strong>n</strong>&nbsp;- the number of primes in our list, and second line containing n space-separated prime numbers. Moreover, following things can be safely assumed:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>n</strong> will be atmost 9 and <strong>m</strong> can be contained in 32-bits.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: small;">Output</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">For each input case x, the output is of the format "Case #x: y", where y =&nbsp;<strong>m</strong> if m is a prime, else y is the largest prime factor of <strong>m</strong>.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: small;">Example</span></h3>
<pre><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Input</span>:</strong>
2<br>3<br>2 3 5<br>4<br>2 7 5 11&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Output:</span></strong>
Case #1: 31<br>Case #2: 257</pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Explanation</strong>:<br></span>Case #1 - 31 is a prime number<br>Case #2 - 2*5*7*11 + 1 = 771, which can be written as 3*257.</pre>
