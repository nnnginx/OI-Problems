<p>Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She has two furrows with plants. Each plant has some kind (denoted by number). Problem is, that as soon as there is a pair of plants with <strong>gcd</strong> greater than 1 in distinct furrows none of them will grow. Ada has decided to throw away minimal number of plants so that every remaining plant will grow up.</p>
<p>She has asked you to count the maximal number of plants which could grow up.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of each test-case will contain two integers <strong>1 ¡Ü N M ¡Ü 800</strong>, the number of plants and first and in second furrow.</p>
<p>The next  will contain <strong>N</strong> integers <strong>1 ¡Ü A<sub>i</sub> ¡Ü 10<sup>6</sup></strong>, the kinds of plants in first furrow.</p>
<p>The next  will contain <strong>M</strong> integers <strong>1 ¡Ü B<sub>i</sub> ¡Ü     10<sup>6</sup></strong>, the kinds of plants in second furrow.</p>
