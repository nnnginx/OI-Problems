<p>Gyanbaba is the wisest saint of the universe. People from all over the world come to him to seek gyan (knowledge). But he does not offer his wisdom to everyone. He choses the right person to give wisdom after taking a test, his murids (apprentices) call this Gyanbaba's Admission Test. For the admission test Gyanbaba writes down a string containing lowercase English letters only and asks the applicants to find the substring of maximum length, the characters of which can be permuted to create a palindrome. Can you pass his test?</p>
