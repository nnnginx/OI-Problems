<p>Like many teenagers of his age, Jagdish is into Honey Singh these  days, and has decided to enter a rapping contest. A rap song can be  represented as a single word of uppercase characters (A-Z). The contest  assigns score based on the smallest length word which is not a substring  of the song. The participant with the highest score gets a chance to  meet with Honey Singh.<br>Jagdish is pumped up about this, and starts  writing his song. He asks Anandi for help. Anandi being a Heavy Metal  fan, dislikes the whole idea. However, she ends up helping Jagdish by  evaluating his songs by finding a string (containing uppercase letters)  with smallest length which is not a substring of the song. If multiple  strings of same lengths are present, the lexicographically smallest one  is considered as the result. Help Anandi find such string.</p>
<p><strong>Input</strong><br>Each line represents an input, consisting of a string (made up of uppercase characters A-Z). Read till EOF</p>
<p><strong>Output<br></strong>For each input, output the result string.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints</strong><br>There will be 100 test cases.<br>1&lt;= Length of input string &lt;= 10^4</p>
<p><strong>Sample Input<br></strong>ABCD<br>BBB</p>
<p><strong>Sample Output</strong><br>E<br>A</p>
