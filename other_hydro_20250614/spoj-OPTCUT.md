<p>You have to cut a piece of wood into n smaller pieces, each piece is of length a<sub>i</sub>. The pieces must be cut <b>in order exactly</b> a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> from left to right.</p>
<p>At each step, you may cut a piece into two smaller pieces. The cost for that cut is the length of the piece before cut.</p>
