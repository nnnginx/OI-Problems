Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as <em>b<sup>n</sup></em>, involving two numbers, the base <em>b</em> and the exponent <em>n</em>. When <em>n</em> is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, <em>b<sup>n</sup></em> is the product of multiplying <em>n</em> bases:</p>

<p><em>b<sup>n</sup></em> =&nbsp; b x b x b x .......... x b</p>

<p>
In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called <em>modulus</em>). Given two positive numbers, <em>a</em> (the dividend) and <em>n</em> (the divisor), <em>a</em> modulo <em>n</em> (abbreviated as <em>a</em> mod <em>n</em>) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of <em>a</em> by <em>n</em>. For instance, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 leaves a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3.
