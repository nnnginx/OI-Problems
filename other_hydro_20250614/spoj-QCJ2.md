<p>There are N numbered boxes placed on a table, let Bi denote the ith box in the line. Write a program that finds the total number of ways to place N identical balls such that atmost k balls are present in the boxes B1, .... ,Bk for 1&lt;=k&lt;=N. Since the number can be quite large you are supposed to output the answer modulo 761238923.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input will contain multiple testcases, on each line N (1&lt;=N&lt;=100) will be given. The last line contains 0 which should not be processed.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each testcase output exactly one line, the total number possible of ways modulo 761238923.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br>1<br>2<br>0<br><strong>Output:</strong>
<br>1<br>2<br></pre>
