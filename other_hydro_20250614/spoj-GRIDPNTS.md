<p>There's a Cartesian lattice with 0&lt;=x,y&lt;=n. Given one point (x1, y1&gt;0) in this lattice rotating clockwise as little as possible around the origin&nbsp;find the next point (x2, y2). The given and searched points mustn't have&nbsp;another point between the origin (0, 0) and this point itself.<br>x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>In the first line the number T (T&lt;10000) of test cases.<br>Then T lines with the space-separated n (1&lt;=n&lt;=1000000), x1 and y1.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case the space-separated x2 and y2.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
