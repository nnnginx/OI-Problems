## 题目描述
It's Bessie's birthday and time for party games! Bessie has instructed the N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows conveniently numbered 1..N to sit in a circle (so that cow i [except at the ends] sits next to cows i-1 and i+1; cow N sits next to cow 1). Meanwhile, Farmer John fills a barrel with one billion slips of paper, each containing some integer in the range 1..1,000,000.

Each cow i then draws a number A\_i (1 <= A\_i <= 1,000,000) (which is not necessarily unique, of course) from the giant barrel.  Taking turns, each cow i then takes a walk around the circle and pats the heads of all other cows j such that her number A\_i is exactly

divisible by cow j's number A\_j; she then sits again back in her original position.

The cows would like you to help them determine, for each cow, the number of other cows she should pat.



## 输入格式
\* Line 1: A single integer: N

\* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: A\_i


## 输出格式
\* Lines 1..N: On line i, print a single integer that is the number of other cows patted by cow i.


## 题目大意
今天是贝茜的生日，为了庆祝自己的生日，贝茜邀你来玩一个游戏。

贝茜让 $N$ ($1\leq N\leq 10^5$) 头奶牛坐成一个圈。除了 $1$ 号与 $N$ 号奶牛外，$i$ 号奶牛与 $i-1$ 号和 $i+1$ 号奶牛相邻。$N$ 号奶牛与 $1$ 号奶牛相邻。农夫约翰用很多纸条装满了一个桶，每一张包含了一个不一定是独一无二的 $1$ 到 $10^6$ 的数字。

接着每一头奶牛 $i$ 从桶中取出一张纸条 $A_i$。每头奶牛轮流走上一圈，同时拍打所有手上数字能整除在自己纸条上的数字的牛的头，然后坐回到原来的位置。牛们希望你帮助他们确定，每一头奶牛需要拍打的牛的数量。
