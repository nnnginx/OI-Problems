<p>In mathematics, the&nbsp;Fibonacci sequence is calculated by adding the previous two members of the sequence. The first few fibonacci numbers are</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Considering the indices start from 1 the 6<sup>th</sup> fibonacci number in this sequence is 8 and is divisible by 1, 2, 4 and 8. You are given two indices L and R (L&lt;=R) of this sequence and you have to calculate how many fibonacci numbers are divisible by M in range [L, R] inclusive.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input begins with a line containing a single integer<strong> T(1&lt;=T&lt;=500)</strong>, denoting the number of test cases. <strong>T</strong> test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing three integers <strong>L R (1&lt;=L&lt;=R&lt;=100000)</strong> and <strong>M (1&lt;=M&lt;=10<sup>18</sup>)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the answer as an integer.</p>
