<p>Recently after girls being allowed to get admitted into IUT, the number of couples in IUT(International University Of Technology) is gradually increasing. In last few months a problem has been noticed. More than one boy/girl had crush on same boy/girl. These created conflicts amongst students. To solve this problem, IUTRC(IUT Relationship Community) came up with a solution. They set up rules with whom a student can only get in a relationship. If your name and the other persons name has a common substing of length k , only then two you can engage yourselves in a relationship. Now, as a loveguru now students are coming to you for knowing if his relationship with his crush possible or not. Help them Love Guru.</p>
