## Description

<div><p>Gellyfish and Flower are playing a game called "Duel".</p><p>Gellyfish has $a$ HP, while Flower has $b$ HP.</p><p>Each of them has a knight. Gellyfish's knight has $c$ HP, while Flower's knight has $d$ HP.</p><p>They will play a game in rounds until one of the players wins. For $k = 1, 2, \ldots$ in this order, they will perform the following actions:</p><ul><li> If $k$ is odd and Gellyfish's knight is alive:<ul> <li> Gellyfish's knight can attack Flower and reduce $b$ by $1$. If $b \leq 0$, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">Gellyfish wins</span>. Or, </li><li> Gellyfish's knight can attack Flower's knight and reduce $d$ by $1$. If $d \leq 0$, Flower's knight dies. </li></ul></li><li> If $k$ is even and Flower's knight is alive:<ul> <li> Flower's knight can attack Gellyfish and reduce $a$ by $1$. If $a \leq 0$, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">Flower wins</span>. Or, </li><li> Flower's knight can attack Gellyfish's knight and reduce $c$ by $1$. If $c \leq 0$, Gellyfish's knight dies. </li></ul></li></ul><p>As one of the smartest people in the world, you want to tell them who will win before the game. Assume both players play optimally.</p><p>It can be proven that the game will never end in a draw. That is, one player has a strategy to end the game in a finite number of moves.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. </p><p>The first and only line of each test case contains four integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ ($1 \leq a, b, c, d \leq 10^9$)&nbsp;�� the HP of Gellyfish, the HP of Flower, the HP of Gellyfish's knight, and the HP of Flower's knight, respectively.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, if Flower will win, output "Flower", otherwise output "Gellyfish".</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, Gellyfish has only $1$ HP. Therefore, no matter what Gellyfish does in the first round, Flower's knight will attack Gellyfish in the second round, allowing Flower to win.</p><p>In the second test case, Flower's knight has only $1$ HP. Gellyfish will attack Flower's knight in the first round. Then Flower's knight will no longer be able to attack, allowing Gellyfish to win.</p>
