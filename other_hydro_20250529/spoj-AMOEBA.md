<p>Dr. Fulano found a new species of microorganism, the fast-growing-amoeba. The colony of this<br>kind of amoeba grows vary fast. To find out the exacty rate of growth of the colony, Dr. Fulano<br>wrote down for several days, the number of amoebae in the colony. Soon he realized that each<br>individual generate daily, 6 new individuals. As the number of amoebae grew very quickly, Dr.<br>Fulano noted only the last K digits. When he realized that the numbers noted were repeated, it was<br>too late! The research was already well advanced and there was no time to recount. The solution<br>was to ask for help from you.</p>
<p><br>Doctor Fulano will give to you a number of K digits (0 &lt; K &lt; 10), possibly with leading zeroes. You<br>should answer the first day he wrote down that number. Consider that in day 1, the colony was<br>composed of 1 amoeba. Consider also that an amoeba does not disappear when generating his<br>descendants.<br>If there is no answer to the number given, print -1.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input is composed by various numbers, each in one line.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each line in input, print a line in output. The line should contains the required answer without<br>leading zeroes.</p>
