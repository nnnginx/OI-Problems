<p>Worried about this, Teresa wants to know the maximum blueberries she can pick, given the number of bushes and the number of blueberries in each bush.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Will contain an integer T, then, T cases will follow, each case starts with a number N and K, being N the number of bushes and K the number of blueberries Teresa will pick as maximum, the next line contains N integers, each one representing the blueberries there is on the i-th bush.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>You will output for each test case the string: <tt>��Scenario #i: ��</tt> where i is the test case you are analyzing, then, an integer denoting the maximum number of blueberries you can grab.</p>
