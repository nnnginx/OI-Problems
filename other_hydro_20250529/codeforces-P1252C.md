## Description

<div><p>Pathfinding is a task of finding a route between two points. It often appears in many problems. For example, in a GPS navigation software where a driver can query for a suggested route, or in a robot motion planning where it should find a valid sequence of movements to do some tasks, or in a simple maze solver where it should find a valid path from one point to another point. This problem is related to solving a maze.</p><p>The maze considered in this problem is in the form of a matrix of integers $A$ of $N \times N$. The value of each cell is generated from a given array $R$ and $C$ of $N$ integers each. Specifically, the value on the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column, cell $(i,j)$, is equal to $R_i + C_j$. Note that all indexes in this problem are from $1$ to $N$.</p><p>A path in this maze is defined as a sequence of cells $(r_1,c_1), (r_2,c_2), \dots, (r_k,c_k)$ such that $|r_i - r_{i+1}| + |c_i - c_{i+1}| = 1$ for all $1 \le i &lt; k$. In other words, each adjacent cell differs only by $1$ row or only by $1$ column. An <span class="tex-font-style-bf">even path</span> in this maze is defined as a path in which all the cells in the path contain only even numbers.</p><p>Given a tuple $\langle r_a,c_a,r_b,c_b \rangle$ as a query, your task is to determine whether there exists an even path from cell $(r_a,c_a)$ to cell $(r_b,c_b)$. To simplify the problem, it is guaranteed that both cell $(r_a,c_a)$ and cell $(r_b,c_b)$ contain even numbers.</p><p>For example, let $N = 5$, $R = \{6, 2, 7, 8, 3\}$, and $C = \{3, 4, 8, 5, 1\}$. The following figure depicts the matrix $A$ of $5 \times 5$ which is generated from the given array $R$ and $C$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="./30636/file/mpE0kyxo.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Let us consider several queries: </p><ul> <li> $\langle 2, 2, 1, 3 \rangle$: There is an even path from cell $(2,2)$ to cell $(1,3)$, e.g., $(2,2), (2,3), (1,3)$. Of course, $(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)$ is also a valid even path. </li><li> $\langle 4, 2, 4, 3 \rangle$: There is an even path from cell $(4,2)$ to cell $(4,3)$, namely $(4,2), (4,3)$. </li><li> $\langle 5, 1, 3, 4 \rangle$: There is no even path from cell $(5,1)$ to cell $(3,4)$. Observe that the only two neighboring cells of $(5,1)$ are cell $(5,2)$ and cell $(4,1)$, and both of them contain odd numbers (<span class="tex-font-style-tt">7</span> and <span class="tex-font-style-tt">11</span>, respectively), thus, there cannot be any even path originating from cell $(5,1)$. </li></ul></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Input begins with a line containing two integers: $N$ $Q$ ($2 \le N \le 100\,000$; $1 \le Q \le 100\,000$) representing the size of the maze and the number of queries, respectively. The next line contains $N$ integers: $R_i$ ($0 \le R_i \le 10^6$) representing the array $R$. The next line contains $N$ integers: $C_i$ ($0 \le C_i \le 10^6$) representing the array $C$. The next $Q$ lines each contains four integers: $r_a$ $c_a$ $r_b$ $c_b$ ($1 \le r_a, c_a, r_b, c_b \le N$) representing a query of $\langle r_a, c_a, r_b, c_b \rangle$. It is guaranteed that $(r_a,c_a)$ and $(r_b,c_b)$ are two different cells in the maze and both of them contain even numbers.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each query in the same order as input, output in a line a string "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" (without quotes) or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" (without quotes) whether there exists an even path from cell $(r_a,c_a)$ to cell $(r_b,c_b)$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>Input begins with a line containing two integers: $N$ $Q$ ($2 \le N \le 100\,000$; $1 \le Q \le 100\,000$) representing the size of the maze and the number of queries, respectively. The next line contains $N$ integers: $R_i$ ($0 \le R_i \le 10^6$) representing the array $R$. The next line contains $N$ integers: $C_i$ ($0 \le C_i \le 10^6$) representing the array $C$. The next $Q$ lines each contains four integers: $r_a$ $c_a$ $r_b$ $c_b$ ($1 \le r_a, c_a, r_b, c_b \le N$) representing a query of $\langle r_a, c_a, r_b, c_b \rangle$. It is guaranteed that $(r_a,c_a)$ and $(r_b,c_b)$ are two different cells in the maze and both of them contain even numbers.</p>

## Output

<p>For each query in the same order as input, output in a line a string "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" (without quotes) or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" (without quotes) whether there exists an even path from cell $(r_a,c_a)$ to cell $(r_b,c_b)$.</p>
