<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the test data will start with an integer T representing the T test cases, then, T cases will follow, each of the cases starts with two integers N and Q, denoting the number of evaluations Orianna had, then, N integers will follow denoting the score on each evaluation, after that, Q queries will begin, each query consist on two integers A and B.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>You must output the string ��<tt>Scenario #i:</tt>��, a blank line and then the result of each query, remember, Orianna is interested on the worst score from evaluation A to evaluation B inclusive.</p>
