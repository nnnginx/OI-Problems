</span></p><p align="justify">The investigation of which regular polygons can be constructed only with compass and straightedge is a classical problem in mathematics. Triangle, square, hexagon can easily be constructed, but, can we construct a regular heptagon? It was the German mathematician Gauss (1777-1855) who first proved that one could construct a 17-sided regular polygon and later, in one the of the most beautiful math works of all time (<em>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</em>, 1798), he gave sufficient conditions to decide which regular polygons can be constructed.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Input</strong> <br>In the first line, an integer T&lt;50000 representing the number of test cases; then, T integer numbers representing the number of sides of a non-degenerated regular polygon, up to 1000000 (10^6).</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Output</strong> <br>Print ¡°Yes¡± if the regular polygon can be constructed with compass and straightedge or ¡°No¡± otherwise.</p>
