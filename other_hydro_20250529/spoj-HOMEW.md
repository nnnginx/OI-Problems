<p>When trying to clean your old room, you find out your old notes from high school.<br>Reading the homeworks you were given then, you start thinking how much easier they<br>would have been today. However, there is a particular one that still seems to maintain<br>its difficulty.</p>
<p>When the solution to a problem involved solving the square root of an integer, to keep<br>a fancy and clean expression, you were asked to express it as the integer part and the<br>root part. This means that if you had as solution N you were asked to express it<br>as √N = A √B with the part A being as high as possible. For instance, 180 can be<br>expressed as 1 √180, 2 √45, 3 √20 or 6 √5. Of course, the last expression is the correct<br>one.</p>
<p>Now that you are grown up, you decide to write a program to perform this task for you.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases, each one described in a single line. The line contains<br>an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>18</sup> ). The last line of the input contains a single −1 and should<br>not be processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with two integers A and B separated by a single<br>space such that √N = A √B and A is maximum.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br>180<br>17<br>1000000000000000000<br>-1<br><br><strong>Output:</strong>
6 5<br>1 17<br>1000000000 1</pre>
