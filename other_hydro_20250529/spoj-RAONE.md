<p>In the War between good and evil . Ra-One is on the evil side and G-One on the good side.</p>
<p>Ra-One is fond of destroying cities and its G-one's duty to protect them..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ra-One loves to destroy cities whose Zip Code has special properties. He says he loves to destroy cities which have Ra-One numbers as their ZIp Code.</p>
<p>Any number is Ra-one if the Difference between Sum of digits at even location and Sum of digits at odd location is One (1).. For eg... for 234563 is Ra-One number</p>
<p>digits at odd location are 3,5,3 (unit place is location 1 )</p>
<p>digits at even location are 2,4,6</p>
<p>Diff = (2+4+6)-(3+5+3)=12-11 = 1.</p>
<p>And 123456 is not Ra-One number</p>
<p>diff = (5+3+1) - (2+4+6) = -4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>G-One knows this about Ra-one and wants to deploy his Army members in those cities. 1 army member will be deployed in each city.</p>
<p>G-one knows the range of ZIP-Codes where Ra-One might attack &amp; needs your help to find out how many army members he needs.</p>
<p>Can you help Him ?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>first line will have only one integer 't' number of Zip-Code ranges. it is followed by t lines</p>
<p>each line from 2nd line cotains 2 integer 'from'&nbsp; and 'to'. these indicate the range of Zip codes where Ra-one might attack .(from and to are included in the range)</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>A single number for each test case telling how many army members G-One needs to deploy.</p>
<p>each number should be on separate lines</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2<br>1 10<br>10 100<br><br><br>&nbsp;<strong>Output:</strong>
<br>1<br>9<br>explanation:</pre>
<pre>for 1st test case the only number is 10</pre>
<pre>for 2nd test case numbers are 10,21,32,43,54,65,76,87,98<br><strong><br>NOTE: </strong>t will be less than 100<br>from and to will be between 0 and 10^8 inclusive </pre>
