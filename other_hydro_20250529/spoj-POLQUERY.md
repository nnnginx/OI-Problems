<p>To  help  capture  criminals  on  the  run,  the  police are  introducing a  new  computer  system.  The  area covered  by  the  police  contains <strong>N</strong> cities  and  <strong>E</strong> bidirectional  roads  connecting  them.  The  cities  are labelled 1 to <strong>N</strong>. The police often want to catch criminals trying to get from one city to another. Inspectors, looking at a map,  try  to determine where to  set up barricades  and  roadblocks.</p>
<p>The new  computer  system  should answer the following two types of queries:</p>
<p>1.  Consider  two  cities <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>,  and  a  road  connecting  cities <strong>G<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>G<sub>2</sub></strong>. Can  the  criminals get from city <strong>A</strong> to city <strong>B</strong> if that one road is blocked and the criminals can't use it?</p>
<p>2.  Consider three cities <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>. Can the criminals get from city <strong>A</strong> to city <strong>B</strong> if the entire city <strong>C</strong> is cut off and the criminals can't enter that city?</p>
<p>Write a program that implements the described system.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The  first  line  contains  two  integers  <strong>N</strong> and  <strong>E</strong> (2  ¡Ü  N  ¡Ü  10<sup>5</sup>, 1  ¡Ü  E  ¡Ü  5*10<sup>5</sup>),  the  number  of  cities  and  roads. Each  of  the  following  <strong>E</strong> lines  contains  two distinct  integers between  1  and  <strong>N</strong> ¨C  the  labels  of  two  cities connected  by  a  road. There  will  be  at  most  one  road  between  any  pair  of  cities.</p>
<p>The  following  line  contains  the  integer  <strong>Q</strong> (1 ¡Ü Q ¡Ü 10<sup>5</sup>),  the  number  of  queries  the  system  is  being tested  on. Each  of  the  following  <strong>Q</strong> lines  contains  either  four  or  five integers.  The  first  of  these  integers  is  the  type  of  the query  ¨C  <strong>1</strong> or  <strong>2</strong>.</p>
<p>If  the  query  is  of  <strong>type  1</strong>,  then  the  same  line  contains  four more  integers  <strong>A</strong>,  <strong>B</strong>,  <strong>G<sub>1</sub></strong> and  <strong>G<sub>2</sub></strong> as  described earlier.  <strong>A</strong> and  <strong>B</strong> will  be  different.  <strong>G<sub>1</sub></strong> and  <strong>G<sub>2</sub></strong> will  represent  an existing  road.</p>
<p>If  the  query  is  of  <strong>type  2</strong>,  then  the  same  line contains  three more  integers  <strong>A</strong>,  <strong>B</strong> and  <strong>C</strong>.  <strong>A</strong>,  <strong>B</strong> and  <strong>C</strong> will  be distinct  integers.</p>
<p>The  test  data  will  be  such  that  it  is  initially  possible  to  get from  each  city  to  every  other  city.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output the answers to all <strong>Q</strong> queries, one per line. The answer to a query can be <em>da</em> (yes) or <em>ne</em> (no).</p>
