## Description

<div><p>This time you should help a team of researchers on an island in the Pacific Ocean. They research the culture of the ancient tribes that used to inhabit the island many years ago.</p><p>Overall they've dug out <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> villages. Some pairs of villages were connected by roads. People could go on the roads in both directions. Overall there were exactly <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i> - 1</span> roads, and from any village one could get to any other one.</p><p>The tribes were not peaceful and they had many wars. As a result of the wars, some villages were destroyed completely. During more peaceful years some of the villages were restored.</p><p>At each moment of time people <span class="tex-font-style-underline">used</span> only those roads that belonged to some shortest way between two villages <span class="tex-font-style-underline">that existed at the given moment</span>. In other words, people used the minimum subset of roads in such a way, that it was possible to get from any existing village to any other existing one. Note that throughout the island's whole history, there existed exactly <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i> - 1</span> roads that have been found by the researchers. There never were any other roads.</p><p>The researchers think that observing the total sum of used roads’ lengths at different moments of time can help to better understand the tribes' culture and answer several historical questions.</p><p>You will be given the full history of the tribes' existence. Your task is to determine the total length of used roads at some moments of time.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">5</sup></span>) — the number of villages.
