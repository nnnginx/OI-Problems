<p>Somehow Sharmeen solved the last problem ¡°<strong>Sharmeen loves substring</strong>¡± and Mozahid became impressed on her performance. Now Mozahid wants to test her programming skill and gives her the hardest problem of today¡¯s problem set. He will give her a string of lowercase English letters of size N( 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5 ) and an integer X( 0 &lt;= X &lt;= 10^12 ). Sharmeen has to find the largest substring of that string, which has exactly X subsequences of ¡®<strong>sms</strong>¡¯. If multiple solution exists, she has to select the leftmost one. If no solution exists, she has to print ¡°-1¡± (Without quotes); otherwise, she has to print the starting and ending position of the substring separated by a space in one line. For exact output format, see the Sample Input Output carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>N.B.</strong> Substring is a consecutive sequence of characters of a string, whereas subsequence does not necessarily need to be consecutive. But for both, you have to maintain the order. For clearance, ¡®skmjssm¡¯ has 2 different subsequences of ¡®sms¡¯.&nbsp; {1,3,5} &amp; {1,3,6} ( 1 based position ).</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">In first line given test case T( 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10 ).</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">For each test case, a string of lowercase English letters of size N( 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^5 ) and an integer X( 0 &lt;= X &lt;= 10^12 ) are given, separated by a space.</span></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p><span lang="EN">For each test case, if solution exists, print the starting and ending position of the substring ( 1 based position ) separated by a space, otherwise print ¡°-1¡± (without quote) in one line .</span></p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
<p>2</p><p>smsmmsms 1</p>mmsm 1

<strong>Output:</strong>
<p>1 5</p><p>-1</p></pre>
