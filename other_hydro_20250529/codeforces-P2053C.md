## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^5$)&nbsp;！ the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^9$).</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;！ the final <span class="tex-font-style-it">lucky value</span>.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, at the beginning, Iris observes $[1, 7]$. Since $[1, 7]$ has an odd length, she aims at star $4$ and therefore increases her <span class="tex-font-style-it">lucky value</span> by $4$. Then it is split into $2$ new segments: $[1, 3]$ and $[5, 7]$. The segment $[1, 3]$ again has an odd length, so Iris aims at star $2$ and increases her <span class="tex-font-style-it">lucky value</span> by $2$. Then it is split into $2$ new segments: $[1, 1]$ and $[3, 3]$, both having a length less than $2$, so no further observation is conducted. For range $[5, 7]$, the progress is similar and the <span class="tex-font-style-it">lucky value</span> eventually increases by $6$. Therefore, the final <span class="tex-font-style-it">lucky value</span> is $4 + 2 + 6 = 12$.</p><p>In the last test case, Iris finally observes all the stars and the final <span class="tex-font-style-it">lucky value</span> is $1 + 2 + \cdots + 8\,765\,432 = 38\,416\,403\,456\,028$.</p>
