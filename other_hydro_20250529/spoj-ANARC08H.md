In the traditional game of Musical Chairs, N + 1  children run around N  chairs (placed in a circle) as long as music is playing. The moment the music stops, children run and try to sit on an available chair. The child still standing leaves the game, a chair is removed, and the game continues with N  children. The last child to sit is the winner.
<br><br>
In an attempt to create a similar game on these days' game consoles, you modify the game in the following manner: N Children are seated on N chairs arranged around a circle. The chairs are numbered from 1 to N . Your program pre-selects a positive number D . The program starts going in circles counting the children starting with the first chair. Once the count reaches D , that child leaves the game, removing his/her chair. The program starts counting again, beginning with the next chair in the circle. The last child remaining in the circle is the winner.<br>

<p style="text-align: left;">For example, consider the game illustrated in the figure above for N = 5  and D = 3 . In the figure, the dot indicates where counting starts and ��  indicates the child leaving. Starting off, child #3 leaves the game, and counting restarts with child #4. Child #1 is the second child to leave and counting restart with child #2 resulting in child #5 leaving. Child #2 is the last to leave, and child #4 is the winner. Write a program to determine the winning child given both N  and D .

</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each test case specifies two positive integers N  and D  on a single line, separated by one or more spaces, where N, D &lt; 1,000,000 .
<br><br>
The last line of the input file contains two 0's and is not part of the test cases. 

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, write the winner using the following format:
<br><br>
N D W
<br><br>
Where N and D are as above, is a space character, and W is the winner of that game.
