<p>Rachid lives on a boat, and owns only a few items, n to be precise. He  takes big care of his items, and measured the weight of each of them  with high precision. Item i weights W<sub>i</sub> micrograms. One night a thief  visits his boat and steels some items. Rachid notices that the next  morning, because the boat is lighter, and he could measure from the  water level that this difference is D micrograms.  He would like to know  how many items are missing, just by examining these weights, and asks  you for help.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input consists of the number of test cases, T. T  test cases follow. Each case consists of two lines, the first one  containing two integers N and D, separated by a space. 	Then second line contains n integers, representing the weights of all  items, separated by space.</p>
<p>The input satisfies the following limits.</p>
<p>1��T��20<br>1��N��30<br>0��D��3*10<sup>10</sup><br> 0��W<sub>i��</sub>10<sup>9</sup></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p><span lang="en">For each test case output  one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting  from 1).  If the number of missing items could be determined, then y is  this number.  If there are several answers to the problem y is the  string "AMBIGIOUS" and if there is no answer y is the string  "IMPOSSIBLE" (quotes added for clarity and are not part of the output). </span></p>
