## Description

**Translated from [ROIR 2021](http://neerc.ifmo.ru/school/archive/2020-2021.html) Day2 T4  [A+B](http://neerc.ifmo.ru/school/archive/2020-2021/ru-olymp-regional-2021-day2.pdf) on this website**.

There are three integers $a,~b,~c$ with length $n$ which may consist of prefix zeros with the following layout that has three lines and $n$ columns.

```
a
b
c
```

Your task is to find the number of ways arranging the columns in which the three integers $x,~y,~z$ horizontally read satisfies that $x+y=z$ and that all those numbers have no prefix zeros.

Since it is possible that large amount of solutions exist, it is only required to output the number of solutions $\bmod 10^9+7$.

## Input Format

Three lines with each line consists of an integer of length $n$.

## Output Format

The number of solutions $\bmod 10^9+7$.

```input1
