<p>Given a series defined by:</p>
<p>F(n)=(F(n-1)+F(n-1)+F(n-1)......+pth time)%1000000007 (10^9+7).</p>
<p>where p is any prime number between (1-100). Now you are provided n and nth term of the sequence. Find the first term of the given series.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input contains only three integers n, nth term and p seperated by spaces.</p>
<p>Here n will be between 1 to 1000000000 inclusive.</p>
<p>and each term ranges between 0 to 1000000006 inclusive.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output a single integer that is first term of the sequence.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input: </strong>5 32 2</pre>
<pre><strong>Output: </strong>2</pre>
