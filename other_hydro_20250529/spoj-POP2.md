<p>A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.</p>
<p>We define here a new prime number called prime of primes number (POP) is a prime number that consists of other prime numbers less than this number.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;1013 consists of 101 and 3 and both are prime.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: 2003 is not POP because leading zeros are not allowed.</p>
<p>The POP numbers must contain more than or equal two primes, and overlapping is not allowed .</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases. (T &lt;= 200)</p>
<p>Followed by&nbsp;T lines, each line contains an integer m number 0 &lt;= m &lt;= 10<sup>18</sup>.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case print single line contain the first integer greater than or equal to m and is (POP) .</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<h4>Input</h4>
<pre>3
10
100
1000</pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<pre>23
113
1013</pre>
