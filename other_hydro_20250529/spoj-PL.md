<p>Asad is a 10 years old boy. He loves to learn new logic from computer science. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome">Palindrome</a> is an interesting topic to him. So, He starts practicing to finding palindrome in his everyday life.</p>
<p><em>A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. such as ¨C madam, 0001000 etc. </em></p>
<p>He faces a problem and asks for your help. You are a great programmer in our country.Now, you have given a string <em>S</em> .  You have to do a permutation of string <em>S</em> through many times (can be 0 times) such that you will get a palindromic string <em>P</em> . You have to check whether it is possible to form a palindrome after any permutation or not.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Every line of the input contains a single&nbsp;string <em>S</em> .</p>
<h4>Constraints:</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>S</em> will consist only of lowercase English letters (i.e. characters 'a' through 'z').</li>
<li>1 ¡Ü <em>|S|</em> ¡Ü 10<sup>5</sup></li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print a single line. Print 1, if it is possible to find at least one valid permutation <em>P</em> of string <em>S</em> which is a palindrome. Otherwise print -1.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
abc
abab
<strong>Output:</strong>
-1
 1
</pre>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>In, Case 2: ¡®baab¡¯ is a valid permutations of string ¡®abab¡¯ which is also a palindrome. So output will be 1.</p>
