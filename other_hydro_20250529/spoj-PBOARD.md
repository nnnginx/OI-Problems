<p>Wango is a brilliant maths teacher. He has two sons Kango and Dango. They are born two years apart on the<br>same day! Kango is 9 and Dango is 7. Their birthdays are approaching again. Wango has to buy them a gift<br>each. After long thought, this time Wango wanted to give each of his sons a piece of the Pango board and thus<br>introduce them to higher mathematics.<br>A size n (n &gt;= 0) Pango board is a 2 by n rectangle of unit squares. A pango board has to be tiled with Pango<br>pieces. Any tiling with the Pango pieces is acceptable. A size 0 Pango board exists and is unique and serves as<br>an example of the empty set.</p>
<p><br>Four types of Pango pieces are available.<br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br>==&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ==&nbsp;&nbsp; ==&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ==<br>XX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X<br>XX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XX&nbsp; X</p>

<p><br>When Wango presents a board to Kango or Dango, he has to tile the board completely with these pieces<br>(unlimited number of pieces of each type are available) and then give them out. Note that pieces cannot be<br>rotated for tiling. To cut costs (recession mind you), Wango decides to buy a single board of size N, then<br>choose a k (0 &lt;= k &lt;= N), and give a size k board to Kango and a size (N-k) board to Dango, (tiled of course).<br>Help him find the number of ways he can give the presents. Two ways are distinct if and only if either Dango<br>gets a different board or Kango gets a different board. Two Pango boards are considered the same if and only<br>if they have the same tiling (same set of tiles at the same places) from left to right (rotation of board is not<br>allowed in comparing).</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input consists of a sequence of cases, one per line.<br>Each case consists of one integer N (0 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000,000,000) representing the size of the board which<br>Wango is going to buy.<br>The input will end with a line containing -1. This case should not be processed.<br>There will be a maximum of 10000 test cases.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>One line per case, outputting the number of ways Wango can distribute the presents to his sons modulo<br>10,007.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br>0<br>1<br>2<br>-1<br><br><strong>Output:</strong><br>1<br>4<br>16<br><br>Explanation:<br>Number of different 0-sized Pango boards = 1<br>Number of different 1-sized Pango boards = 2<br>Number of different 2-sized Pango boards = 6<br>For N = 0, he has to give 0-sized boards to both his sons. He can do this in 1*1 = 1 way<br>For N = 1, he has to give 0-sized board to one of his sons, and 1-sized board to the other, for a total of 2*1 +<br>1*2 = 4 ways<br>For N = 2, he can give the presents in 6*1 + 2*2 + 1*6 = 16 ways<br></pre>
