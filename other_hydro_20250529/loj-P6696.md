## Description

We call a sequence $a$ good iff $1\le a_i\le k(1\le i\le n)$ and for all $x$, the occurrences of $x$ in $a$ is a multiple of $d$. Please count the number of good sequences. Since the answer could be extremely large, you just need to calculate it modulo $19491001$.


## Input Format

One line with three positive integers $n,k,d$.

## Output Format

Output one integer which is the answer modulo $19491001$.


```input1
8 3 4
```

```output1
213
```

```input2
12 4 6
```

```output2
5548
```

## Limits

For $50\%$ of the testcases, $d = 4, k\le 2\times 10^3$.

For the rest $50\%$ of the testcases, $d = 6, k\le 10^3$.

It's guaranteed that $n\le 10^9$.
