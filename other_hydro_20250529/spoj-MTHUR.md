<p>In earlier days , grading&nbsp; in&nbsp; BITS&nbsp; used to be absolute , instead of relative grading scheme .<br>Once Professor Mathur decided to conduct a surprise quiz, and many students were caught unaware of it.&nbsp;<br>Their scores of the students came&nbsp;out to be much worse than the previous years scores.</p>
<p><br>Professor Mathur really believed that true test of talent comes in difficult situations and continued such horrifying sequences of tests . But finally poor placements of his students turned the heat up for the professor and he decided to revise everyone's marks .<br>&nbsp;<br>Now being a qualified mathematician , professor mathur applied a simple strategy to this.<br>He decided to award some constant grace marks to each and every student. <br>He took every students last year marks and then added up the absolute difference with the <br>revised current year marks&nbsp; . And he decided to choose the grace marks with the least sum of absolute difference .<br>ie. sum( abs (a[i] - (b[i]+grace) )&nbsp; ) should be minimum .<br>Also , prof. Mathur had a knack of choosing the grace value from his very set of favourite numbers .</p>
<p><br>Now that our students are happily placed in&nbsp; 'Microsoft' , 'Adobe' for the good <img title="Cool" src="../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-cool.gif" border="0" alt="Cool">, credit finally goes to professor "mathur" .<br>Now , decide for each input ,what grace marks were given by mathur .<br>(if there are many such grace marks , choose the lowest one) .</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line , t for number of testcases. Next 5*t line for each testcase .<br>First line of every testcase : integer n.<br>Second line : n integers showing previous years marks of every student .<br>Third line : n integers showing present years marks of every student .<br>Fourth line : intger m<br>Fifth line : m integers showing the possible values for grace marks</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output the expected grace marks .</p>
