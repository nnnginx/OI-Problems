## Description

*Thanks @[reek](https://loj.ac/user/3003) for inventing this problem and @[_rqy](https://loj.ac/user/686) for the solution.*

One day you found a magical function $g(x)$ which satisfies many properties:

1. $g(1)=1$¡£
2. $g(p^c)=p \oplus c$£¨$p$ is prime£¬$\oplus$ denotes bitwise exclusive or£©¡£
3. $g(ab)=g(a)g(b)$£¨$a$ and $b$ are coprime numbers£©¡£

You were happy to find this function so you wanted to find $\sum_{i=1}^n g(i)$.

----

However, eventually you couldn't come up with any ideas. Therefore, you asked @[henry_y](https://loj.ac/user/6189).

henry_y: Isn't this problem [from LibreOJ](https://loj.ac/problem/6053)? 

henry_y thought this problem was too simple so he asked you another problem.

Let

$$f(n) = \left( \sum_{i = 1}^n \left\lfloor \frac ni \right\rfloor^2 g(i) \right) \bmod 998244353$$

Find $f(1) \oplus f(2) \oplus \ldots \oplus f(n)$¡£

## Input

The first line contains a positive integer $n$.

## Output

The first line contains a non-negative integer, representing the answer.

## Limits And Hints

**Update 2019/7/10 20:23£ºWe have set the time limit to 1500ms. The using time of standard program on each test did not exceed 500ms, though, so please notice the constant factor's effect.**

For $10\%$ of data£¬$n \leq 100$¡£

For $30\%$ of data£¬$n \leq 50000$¡£

For $50\%$ of data£¬$n \leq 10^6$¡£

For $100\%$ of data£¬$n \leq 10^7$¡£
