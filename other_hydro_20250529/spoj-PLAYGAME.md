Hemlata and Ragini were playing a game from a number of coins. Hemlata was jealous of Ragini. She wanted to win at all cost. A stack consists of <b>n</b> coins. Any player can take either 1, 2 or 5 (anyone number of coins) coins from stack at a time. Both Hemlata and Ragini play their moves alternatively.
</p>
<p>
Hemlata always starts first. Both play optimally. Your job is to predict the output beforehand. A player who can't take any coin loses the game. A player can take only one of 1, 2, 5 number of coins at a time in a move.
