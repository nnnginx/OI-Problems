<p>The general elections are coming and so rahul and modi have started the preparations.An astrologer predicted that whoever solves the given problem first will win the elections.</p>
<p>The problem is as follows: Given an array <code>nums</code> of <em>n</em> integers, are there elements <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> in <code>nums</code> such that <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.</p>
<p>As I want modi to win,so you have to solve this problem for modi before rahul does...Good Luck</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>In the first line ,you will be given t the number of test cases ,for each test case you will be given n, the size of the array.In the next line you will be given n space separated elements of the array.</p>
<p>Input constraints :t&lt;=10000, n&lt;=10000 (sum of n over all test cases won't exceed 10^8)</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output the number of such triplets and subsequently print each of the triplets in a separate line in lexicographic order.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br>2<br>5<br>-1 0 1 2 -1<br>3<br>0 0 0<br>&nbsp;<strong>Output:</strong><br>2 <br>-1 -1 2<br>-1 0 1<br>1<br>0 0 0 <br></pre>
