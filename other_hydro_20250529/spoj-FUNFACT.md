<p>Ling: Stir, let's go out and play our favorite game.</p>
<p>Stir: I am already having fun with my first factorial program.</p>
<p>Ling: Than I will give you a challenge on factorials. If you fail in it, you will have to come.</p>
<p>Stir: ok..</p>
<p>Ling gives Stir a number x and the challenge is to find the largest value of n such that n! is not greater than the largest value that can be formed by x digits. Stir is stuck with the problem and needs your help. Now, it's your turn to make sure that Stir can continue having fun with factorials.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains a number t (about 10^5), the number of the test cases. The next t lines contain a number x (1 &lt;= x &lt;= 10^9).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output a total of t lines with each line containing the value n corresponding to the input case.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> <br>2<br>1<br>7<br><br><strong>Output:</strong> <br>3<br>10
