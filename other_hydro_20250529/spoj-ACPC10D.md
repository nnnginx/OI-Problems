<p>Here��s a simple graph problem: Find the shortest path from the top-middle vertex to the bottom-middle vertex in a given tri-graph. A tri-graph is an acyclic graph of (N �� 2) rows and exactly 3 columns. Unlike regular graphs, the costs in a tri-graph are associated with the vertices rather than the edges.</p>

<p>So, considering the example with N = 4, the cost of going straight down from the top to bottom along the middle vertices is 7 + 13 + 3 + 6 = 29. The layout of the directional edges in the graph are always the same as illustrated in the figure.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.<br>Each test case is specified using N + 1 lines where the first line specifies a single integer (2 �� N �� 100, 000) denoting the number of rows in the graph. N lines follow, each specifying three integers representing the cost of the vertices on the ith row from left to right. The square of each cost value is less than 1,000,000.<br>The last case is followed by a line with a single zero.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print the following line:<br>k. n<br>Where k is the test case number (starting at one,) and n is the least cost to go from the top-middle vertex to the bottom-middle vertex.</p>
