## Description

An integer is considered handsome if every two of its consecutive digits are of different parity. For a given integer $N$, what is its closest handsome number?

Please note: Numbers consisting of only one digit are handsome numbers. The distance of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.

## Output

The first and only line of output must contain the required closest handsome number. If two closest numbers exist, output the smaller number first and then the larger one and separate them by a single space.
