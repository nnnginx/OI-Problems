For your math homework this week your teacher gave you five large numbers and asked you to find their prime factors. However these numbers aren't&nbsp;<em>nearly</em>&nbsp;large enough for someone with knowledge of programming like yourself. So you decide to take the factorial of each of these numbers. Recall that N! (N factorial) is the product of the integers from 1 through N (inclusive). It¡¯s your job now to create a program to help you do your homework.

<h3><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Input</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Each test case contains a number N (2 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 10000).</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">Output</span></h3>
<p>
<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times;">
The output should contain a line&nbsp;representing the prime factorization of the factorial given number, which should be of the form:&nbsp;<em>p<sub>1</sub>^e<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;* p<sub>2</sub>^e<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;* ... * p<sub>k</sub>^e<sub>k</sub></em> where p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>k</sub> are the distinct prime factors of the factorial of the given number in increasing order, and e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, ..., e<sub>k</sub>&nbsp;are their exponents.
