<p>We define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the following illustrative image:<br>

<p>And we continue defining the LEVEL of a hexagon. It's called level N hexagon if it¡¯s joined by 6 triangles, each one is a level N triangle.<br>
</p><center><img src="./24627/file/AMqs2BQO.png"></center><br>
<p><b>Task:</b> All you have to do is to count all triangles in the ¡°level N¡± hexagon.

</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N which is the level of the hexagon in that test case.

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, you should write a seperate line: the number of triangles in the ¡°level N¡± hexagon. (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit positive integer)

</p><h3>Example</h3>
