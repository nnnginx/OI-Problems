<p>A digit in a number N is a minima if it is lesser than both the digits adjacent to it. Similarly, a digit is a maxima if it is greater than both the digits adjacent to it. The slope of N is the number of digits in N (leaving out the first and the last digit) which are either a minima or a maxima. Given A and B, count the sum of the slopes of all numbers between A and B.<br><br>Input :<br>The first line contains the number of test cases T.
