<p>Substrings are consecutive parts of a string. A problem usually solved with dynamic programming is to find the longest common substring problem is to find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two strings.<br>Your task is to find the length of the longest common substring of K strings.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases (1 ¡Ü T ¡Ü 20) . Each test case, consists of one line containing an integer K (1 ¡Ü K ¡Ü 10), and K lines, each containing a string (length of s &lt;= 10^4), the strings only contain the character ¡®a¡¯ ¨C ¡®z¡¯.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the required sequence, with a blank space between consecutive terms. It is guaranteed that all terms in the sequence are integers.</p>
