Changu and Mangu are afraid of prime numbers, but they are not afraid&nbsp;of all prime numbers. They were afraid of only a special kind of prime numbers. They are afraid of the prime numbers (without the digit zero, they love all the primes which have digits 0 in them)&nbsp;that remain prime no matter how many of the leading digits are omitted.&nbsp;For example, they are afraid of 4632647 because it doesn't have the digit 0 and&nbsp;each of its truncations (632647, 32647, 2647, 647, 47, and 7) are primes.
