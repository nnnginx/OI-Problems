<p>You are given a room of length <strong>L</strong> and breadth <strong>B</strong> which is dividen into unit cells. In each unit cell there are some gems which amount to a certain value which can be positive, negative or even zero. You are asked to answer <strong>T</strong> queries. Each query consists of a number <strong>N</strong> and you need to collect gems from <strong>N </strong>unit cells such that the value of <strong>N</strong> unit cells when summed up must be maximum. The selection of <strong>N </strong>unit cells in a room of length L and breadth B must be in such a way that it must be a small room of length say some <strong>x</strong> and breadth some <strong>y</strong> provided <strong>x*y=N</strong>.If No such value for x and y exist then print -1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Input</strong></p>
<p>First line of input contains two space separated integers L and B which denotes the length and breadth of the room.</p>
<p>Following L lines contains B elements in each line each element specifying the value of the gems.</p>
<p>Next line contains T which is the number of queries.</p>
<p>Following T lines contains T elements where each element is the number N.</p>
<p><strong>1&lt;=L,B&lt;=1000</strong></p>
<p>All the L*B elements(x) will be in the range <strong>-100&lt;=x&lt;=100</strong></p>
<p><strong>1&lt;=T&lt;=10</strong></p>
<p><strong>1&lt;=N&lt;=10000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<p>Print the maximum value that can be obtained for each value of N.</p>
