## Description

<div><p> </p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, $k=0$. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.</span> </p><p>Ecrade has two sequences $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n - 1}$ and $b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{n - 1}$ consisting of integers.

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $k = 0$).</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n - 1}$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$).</p><p>The third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{n - 1}$ ($1 \le b_i \le 10^9$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$. It is also guaranteed that in each test case the sum of $a$ does not exceed the sum of $b$, and that $k$ does not exceed the sum of $a$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output the minimum number of rounds required for all elements in $a$ to become equal to $0$ after exactly $k$ changes to $a$.</p>

## Note

<p>In this version, Ecrade cannot make changes to $a$.</p><p>In the first test case:</p><ul> <li> After the first round, $a=[0,0,0],b=[4,0,0]$. </li></ul><p>In the second test case:</p><ul> <li> After the first round, $a=[3,0,0,1],b=[3,1,0,0]$; </li><li> After the second round, $a=[1,0,0,0],b=[0,1,0,0]$; </li><li> After the third round, $a=[0,1,0,0],b=[0,1,0,0]$; </li><li> After the fourth round, $a=[0,0,0,0],b=[0,0,0,0]$. </li></ul>
