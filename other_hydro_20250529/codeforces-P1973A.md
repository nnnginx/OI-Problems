## Description

<div><p>Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.</p><p>In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets $2$ points while the loser gets $0$, and in case of a draw, both players get $1$ point each. Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at all. </p><p>You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$. Additionally, it is guaranteed that $p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3$ holds.</p><p>Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If there isn't any way to obtain $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ as a result of a non-negative number of games between the three players, print $-1$ instead.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ ($0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30$) ！ the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each testcase, print one number ！ the maximum possible number of draws that could've happened, or $-1$ if the scores aren't consistent with any valid set of games and results.</p></div>

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ ($0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30$) ！ the scores of the three players, sorted non-decreasingly.</p>

## Output

<p>For each testcase, print one number ！ the maximum possible number of draws that could've happened, or $-1$ if the scores aren't consistent with any valid set of games and results.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur either.</p><p>For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is $1$.</p><p>It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third example, so the answer for it is $-1$.</p>
