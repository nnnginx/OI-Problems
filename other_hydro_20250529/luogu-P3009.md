## 题目描述
The cows have opened a new business, and Farmer John wants to see how well they are doing. The business has been running for N (1 <= N <= 100,000) days, and every day i the cows recorded their net profit P\_i (-1,000 <= P\_i <= 1,000).

Farmer John wants to find the largest total profit that the cows have made during any consecutive time period. (Note that a consecutive time period can range in length from one day through N days.) Help him by writing a program to calculate the largest sum of consecutive profits.


奶牛们开始了新的生意，它们的主人约翰想知道它们到底能做得多好。这笔生意已经做了N（1≤N≤100,000）天，每天奶牛们都会记录下这一天的利润Pi（-1,000≤Pi≤1,000）。


约翰想要找到奶牛们在连续的时间期间所获得的最大的总利润。（注：连续时间的周期长度范围从第一天到第N天）。


请你写一个计算最大利润的程序来帮助他。


## 输入格式
\* Line 1: A single integer: N

\* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: P\_i


## 输出格式
\* Line 1: A single integer representing the value of the maximum sum of profits for any consecutive time period.


```input1
7 
-3 
4 
9 
-2 
-5 
8 
-3 

```

```output1
14 

```

## 提示
The maximum sum is obtained by taking the sum from the second through the sixth number (4, 9, -2, -5, 8) => 14.
