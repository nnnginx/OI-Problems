<p>Lazy Louie loves to eat but he adamantly hates cleaning. &nbsp;That is why he has chosen to delay&nbsp;</p>
<p>cleaning for as long as possible. &nbsp;Being an avid inventor, Louie created an invention to help&nbsp;</p>
<p>increase his laziness. &nbsp;That invention is the two sided plate! &nbsp;Two sided plates can be stacked like&nbsp;</p>
<p>coins for easy storage. &nbsp;They also have the interesting feature that you may eat from either side&nbsp;</p>
<p>of the plate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lazy Louie lacks cabinet space. &nbsp;That is why he stores his two sided plates directly on his dining&nbsp;</p>
<p>table. &nbsp;When enjoying a meal he simply eats off the topmost plate, although he will only eat off&nbsp;</p>
<p>the topmost surface if it is clean. &nbsp;When the plates are stacked, if a dirty side of the plate touches&nbsp;</p>
<p>the clean side of another plate then the grime of that plate transfers to the clean plate making that&nbsp;</p>
<p>side of the plate dirty. &nbsp;The side that was originally dirty stays dirty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Louie is stacking plates on his table, if a dirty side of a plate touches the table then the&nbsp;</p>
<p>grime will transfer to the table making the table dirty. &nbsp;If the table is dirty already and it touches&nbsp;</p>
<p>a clean side of a plate then that plate¡¯s side becomes dirty. &nbsp;Note that the table remains dirty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, both sides remain dirty when two dirty sides, either the table or plates, touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>
<p>Louie would like to know the maximum number of meals that can be eaten before any cleaning&nbsp;</p>
<p>is done. &nbsp;Louie is given the number of plates he already has of three kinds: plates that are clean&nbsp;</p>
<p>on both sides, plates that are clean on one side while dirty on the other, and plates that are dirty&nbsp;</p>
<p>on both sides. &nbsp;Before eating his first meal he can stack these plates in any way he likes on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>table. &nbsp;After eating each meal the topmost plate becomes dirty. &nbsp;Between meals Louie can&nbsp;</p>
<p>rearrange the plates in any way he likes. &nbsp;Louie is allowed to change the order of the plates on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the stack and change which side is facing up but they must remain a stack of plates after being&nbsp;</p>
<p>rearranged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first input line contains a positive integer, n, indicating the number of eating scenarios to&nbsp;</p>
<p>analyze. &nbsp;The next n lines contain the description of the plates. &nbsp;Each line contains three integers,&nbsp;</p>
<p>c, s, and d, (0 ¡Ü c ¡Ü 100; 0 ¡Ü s ¡Ü 100; 0 ¡Ü d ¡Ü 100) representing (respectively) the number of&nbsp;</p>
<p>plates with both sides clean, the number of plates with one side clean and the number of&nbsp;</p>
<p>completely dirty plates.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each scenario, first output the heading ¡°Scenario #d: ¡±, where d is the scenario number,&nbsp;</p>
<p>starting with 1. Then, print the maximum number of times a meal can be eaten before Louie has&nbsp;</p>
<p>to clean. Follow the format illustrated in Sample Output.</p>
