<p>You are given a string S which consists of 250000 lowercase latin letters at most. We define F(x) as the maximal number of times that some string with length x appears in S. For example for string 'ababa' F(3) will be 2 because there is a string 'aba' that occurs twice. Your task is to output F(i) for every i so that 1&lt;=i&lt;=|S|.</p>
