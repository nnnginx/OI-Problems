<p>The N (1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 50,000) cows, conveniently numbered 1, 2, ..., N, are trying to learn some encryption algorithms. After studying a few examples, they have decided to make one of their own! However, they are not very experienced at this, so their algorithm is very simple:</p>

<p>Each cow i is given a starting number C<sub>i</sub> (0 ¡Ü C<sub>i</sub> &lt; 90,000,000), and then all the cows perform the following process in parallel:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, each cow finds the sum of the numbers of the other N-1 cows.</li>
<li>After all cows are finished, each cow replaces her number with the sum she computed. To avoid very large numbers, the cows will keep track of their numbers modulo 98,765,431.</li>
</ul>

<p>They told Canmuu the moose about it in November; he was quite impressed. Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Canmuu came to say:</p>

<blockquote>"Your algorithm is too easy to break! You should repeat it T (1 ¡Ü T ¡Ü 1,414,213,562) times instead."</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, the cows were very frustrated with having to perform so many repetitions of the same boring algorithm, so after many hours of arguing, Canmuu and the cows reached a compromise: You are to calculate the numbers after the encryption is performed!</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<ul>
<li>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and T.</li>
<li>Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: C<sub>i</sub>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lines 1..N: Line i contains a single integer representing the number of cow i (modulo 98,765,431) at the end of the encryption.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following is a table of the cows' numbers for each turn:</p>
