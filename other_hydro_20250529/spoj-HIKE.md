<p>"Hike on a Graph" is a game that is played on a board on
which an undirected graph is drawn. The graph is complete and has
all loops, i.e. for any two locations there is exactly one arrow
between them. The arrows are coloured. There are three players, and
each of them has a piece. At the beginning of the game, the three
pieces are in fixed locations on the graph. In turn, the players
may do a move. A move consists of moving one's own piece along an
arrow to a new location on the board. The following constraint is
imposed on this: the piece may only be moved along arrows of the
same colour as the arrow between the two opponents' pieces.

In the sixties ("make love not war") a one-person variant
of the game emerged. In this variant one person moves all
the three pieces, not necessarily one after the other, but
of course only one at a time. Goal of this game is to get
all pieces onto the same location, using as few moves as
possible. Find out the smallest number of moves that is
necessary to get all three pieces onto the same location,
for a given board layout and starting positions.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input file contains several test cases. Each test
case starts with the number <i>n</i>. Input is terminated
by <i>n=0</i>. Otherwise, <i>1&lt;=n&lt;=50</i>. Then
follow three integers <i>p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>,
p<sub>3</sub></i> with <i>1&lt;=p<sub>i</sub>&lt;=n</i>

denoting the starting locations of the game pieces. The
colours of the arrows are given next as a <i>n¡Án</i>
matrix <i>m</i> of whitespace-separated lower-case letters. The
element <i>m<sub>ij</sub></i> denotes the colour of the
arrow between the locations <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. Since
the graph is undirected, you can assume the matrix to be
symmetrical.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output on a single line the minimum number of moves
required to get all three pieces onto the same location, or the word
"impossible" if that is not possible for the given board and starting
locations.</p>
