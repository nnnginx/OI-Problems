<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are given n points in a 2D plane. You are asked these an inherently simple questions about them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You&nbsp; have to find out number of right angle triangles (having base and height parrallel to axis) with the property that length of base and height is same.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First Line will n: number of points. (n &lt;= 10^5).</p>
<p>For next n lines&nbsp; each line will contain two integers x and y.&nbsp; (-10^8 &lt;= x, y &lt;= 10^8).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>You have to output a single line containing the answer to question.</p>

<h3><strong>Example</strong></h3>
