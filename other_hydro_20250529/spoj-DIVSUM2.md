<p>Given a natural number n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1e16), please output the summation of all its proper divisors.

</p><p><em>Definition:</em> A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.

</p><p>e.g. number 20 has 5 proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and the divisor summation is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22.

</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>An integer stating the number of test cases (equal to 500), and that many lines follow, each containing one integer between 1 and 1e16 inclusive.

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>One integer each line: the divisor summation of the integer given respectively.

</p><h3>Example</h3>
