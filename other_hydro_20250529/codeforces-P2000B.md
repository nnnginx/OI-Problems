## Description

<div><p>In Berland, a bus consists of a row of $n$ seats numbered from $1$ to $n$. Passengers are advised to always board the bus following these rules: </p><ul> <li> If there are no occupied seats in the bus, a passenger can sit in any free seat;</li><li> Otherwise, a passenger should sit in any free seat that has at least one occupied neighboring seat. In other words, a passenger can sit in a seat with index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) only if at least one of the seats with indices $i-1$ or $i+1$ is occupied. </li></ul><p>Today, $n$ passengers boarded the bus. The array $a$ chronologically records the seat numbers they occupied. That is, $a_1$ contains the seat number where the first passenger sat, $a_2$ �� the seat number where the second passenger sat, and so on.</p><p>You know the contents of the array $a$. Determine whether all passengers followed the recommendations.</p><p>For example, if $n = 5$, and $a$ = [$5, 4, 2, 1, 3$], then the recommendations were not followed, as the $3$-rd passenger sat in seat number $2$, while the neighboring seats with numbers $1$ and $3$ were free.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) �� the number of test cases.</p><p>The following describes the input test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains exactly one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) �� the number of seats in the bus and the number of passengers who boarded the bus.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) �� the seats that the passengers occupied in chronological order.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ values across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$, and that no passenger sits in an already occupied seat.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output on a separate line: </p><ul> <li> "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>", if all passengers followed the recommendations; </li><li> "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" otherwise. </li></ul><p>You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yEs</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yes</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">Yes</span>", and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" will be recognized as a positive answer).</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) �� the number of test cases.</p><p>The following describes the input test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains exactly one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) �� the number of seats in the bus and the number of passengers who boarded the bus.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) �� the seats that the passengers occupied in chronological order.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ values across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$, and that no passenger sits in an already occupied seat.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output on a separate line: </p><ul> <li> "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>", if all passengers followed the recommendations; </li><li> "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" otherwise. </li></ul><p>You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yEs</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yes</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">Yes</span>", and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" will be recognized as a positive answer).</p>
