<p>Jumping Zippy likes to jump. He jumps every day and feels boring. Then he think of a new way to jump. He jumps on a big round plaza. The plaza is divided into n sectors numbered clockwise from 0 to n-1. Firstly, he stands on sector 0. Each time, when he is stand on sector x, he can jump to sector (x-2)%n, (x-1)%n, (x+1)%n or (x+2)%n. His goal is to jump to each sector exactly once and jump back to sector 0 at last. And for the first jump, he never jumps to sector n-1 or sector n-2. He wants to find the number of different ways in which he can complete his goal.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line is a number t, which is the number of testcases. (1&lt;=t&lt;=1000)</p>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 104px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The following t lines, each line contains a integer n, which is the number of sectors. (5&lt;=n&lt;=10^18)</div>
<p>Then following t lines, each line contains a integer n, which is the number of sectors. (5&lt;=n&lt;=10^18)</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em;"><strong>Output</strong></h3>
<p>For each query n, output a line which contains one integer, the number of different ways Zippy can complete his goal in, modulo 10^9+9.</p>
