X and Y are playing the following game:
They start with an empty 2xN board and move alternately. X moves first. In a move, a player must place an L-triomino (shown on the right), in any of the 4 possible orientations, on the board. The piece placed must not overlap with a piece that has already been placed. The player that is unable to make a valid move loses. </p>
<p>
Given the size of the board, find out who will win the game assuming that both X and Y play optimally

</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>
Input consists of multiple test-cases. The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. (T&lt;=50)</p> <p> 
Each test-case consists of a single line containing a single integer N, the size of the board. (N&lt;=800) 
</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test-case, output a single line containing "X" or "Y" depending on who wins that game. 
</p><h3>Example</h3>
