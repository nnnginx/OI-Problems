<p>You are given four strings, each consisting of at most 50 lower case letters ('a'-'z'). Count the number of non-empty common subsequences of them (the number of distinct non-empty strings which are subsequences of all four strings). Note that a subsequence does not have to be contiguous.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Four lines: each line consists of a single string.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>An integer representing the answer.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
aabb
abab
baba
acba

<b>Output:</b>
4
</pre>

<p>The four sequences are "a", "b", "aa", and "ab".</p>
