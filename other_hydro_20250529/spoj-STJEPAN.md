<p>Little Stjepan lives in a village which can be represented as X-axis. In village there are N beer machines, machine i has x coordinate P<sub>i</sub> and needs T<sub>i</sub> seconds to produce 1 liter of beer.</p>
<p>This year M tourists (one by one because there is only one guide, Stjepan) will visit his village, tourist i will arrive at point A<sub>i</sub>, want to drink L<sub>i</sub> liters of beer but will have energy to walk at most D<sub>i</sub> seconds (that is D<sub>i</sub> units of length), he will walk to beer machine Stjepan suggests him and as soon as machine produces L<sub>i</sub> liters of beer tourist will be able to enjoy it.</p>
<p>As Stjepan wants all tourists to come next year too he will choose machine for each tourist so that tourist can get a beer as soon as possible. Help Stjepan to do that and write program which will output minimal sum of passed times from arrival of tourist to getting a beer. If a tourist can't get a beer then his time is 0.</p>
<p>Note that tourists are independent and machines can be used multiple times.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>On first line of standard input you are given two integers (2 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 250 000, 1 ¡Ü M ¡Ü 500 000), number of beer machines and number of tourists.</p>
<p>Next 5 lines contain 4 integers (X<sub>0</sub>, A, B, C) each and they describe arrays P, T, A, L and D, respectively.<br>With these four numbers i-th element of array is defined as X<sub>i</sub> = 1 + ((X<sub>i-1</sub>*A + B) mod C), where indices are 1-based and X<sub>0</sub> is given in input.</p>
<p>1 ¡Ü X<sub>0</sub>, A, B, C&nbsp;¡Ü&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Author's solution doesn't depend on properties of pseudo-random generator.</p>
