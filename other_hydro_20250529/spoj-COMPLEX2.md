ABHISHEK is weak of mathematics he is not able to solve the sequences frequently.
</p>

<p>
So he invited topcoders to develop a program for solving the sequence. He managed to solve the other kind of sequences except one kind.
</p>

<p>
The sequence description is as follows:</p><p>(x-w)(x-w^2)(x-w^3)(x-w^4).............(x-w^n-1)<br><br>
here x is a number and w is nth root of unity.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>first line contain number of test cases t. Then t line follow x and n. x and n seprated by a space.</p>

<p><b>Constraints:</b></p>
<p>2&lt;=x&lt;=1000</p>
<p>2&lt;=n&lt;=1000</p>
<p>t&lt;=410</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>print result per case according to above sequence and also keep in mind if there is any term in&nbsp;decimal then write it in form of &nbsp;num/deno. see the I/O for further detail</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Input:</b>
1
5 10

<b>Output:</b>
9765624/4</pre>
