<p>Ivica has set up a new parquet flooring in his room. The room is L decimeters long and W decimeters&nbsp;wide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The blocks are of quadratic shape and each has an area of one quadratic decimeter. Once Ivica had set&nbsp;up the flooring, which consists of brown.colored blocks, he decided to paint the blocks on the edge&nbsp;of the room red.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The picture below illustrates the scenario from the test case #2 ¨C outer blocks are red, while the&nbsp;remaining two inner blocks are brown:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marica has come to visit Ivica. While Ivica was serving her cookies, she counted the number of blocks&nbsp;of each color. When she returned home, she recalled of the two numbers and wished to calculate the&nbsp;dimensions of Ivica¡¯s room. Help her!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first and only line of input contains two integers separated by a space, &nbsp;R (the number of red blocks) and B (the number of brown blocks). The following constraints will apply: 8 ¡Ü R ¡Ü 5000, 1 ¡Ü&nbsp;B ¡Ü 2*10<sup>6</sup>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the dimensions of the room, L and W, respectively. If the numbers differ, output the greater one first. The test data will ensure that a unique solution always exists.</p>

<pre><strong>input 1:</strong>
8 1

<strong>output 1:</strong>
3 3</pre>

<pre><strong>input 2:</strong>
10 2

<strong>output 2:</strong>
