<p>This problem tests your mathematic knowledge and your programming ability very much. Your task is to calculate the number of different Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) of a special undirected unweighted graph. The graph has n nodes numbered from 1 to n, and there is an edge between node i (1&lt;=i&lt;=n) and node j (1&lt;=j&lt;=n) if and only if 0&lt;|i-j|&lt;=k.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Multiple test cases, the number of them(&lt;=8) is given in the very first line.</p>
<p>Each test case contains one line with two space-separated numbers k(1&lt;=k&lt;=5) and n(1&lt;=n&lt;=10<sup>15</sup>).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case you should output one line, the number of different MSTs of the corresponding graph modulo 65521. </p>
