<p>Given two nonnegative integers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, you are to generate the solution of the equation <b>b*x=a</b>.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The number of test cases is given in the very first line. For each test case there is a single line containing two integers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> without any leading zeroes, separated by a single space.</p>
<p><i>Tip</i>: For more than 95% of test cases, <b>int</b> in C/C++/Java or <b>longint</b> in Pascal is enough.</p>
<p>The input file is about 1.4 KB.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the root in decimal cyclic notations, or "Invalid Input!!!"(without quotes) if the solution is not unique or the solution doesn't exist. See the example for more details.</p>
<p>The output file is about 1.3MB.</p>
