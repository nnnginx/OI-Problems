<p>Josip is a strange painter. He wants to paint a picture consisting of N¡ÁN pixels, where N is a power of
two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 etc.). Each pixel will be either black or white. Josip already has an idea of how each
pixel will be coloured.</p>
<p>This would be no problem if Josip's painting process wasn't strange. He uses the following recursive
process:</p>
<ul>
<li> If the picture is a single pixel, he colours it the way he intended. </li>
<li> Otherwise, split the square into four smaller squares and then: 
<ul>
<li>1. Select one of the four squares and colour it white.</li>
<li>2. Select one of the three remaining squares and colour it black.</li>
<li>3. Consider the two remaining squares as new paintings and use the same three-step process
on them. </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Soon he noticed that it was not possible to convert all his visions to paintings with this process. Your
task is to write a program that will paint a picture that differs as little as possible from the desired
picture. The difference between two pictures is the number of pairs of pixels in corresponding
positions that differ in colour. </p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer N (1 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 512), the size of the picture Josip would like to paint. N
will be a power of 2.</p>
<p>Each of the following N lines contains N digits 0 or 1, white and black squares in the target picture.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>On the first line, output the smallest possible difference that can be achieved.</p>
<p>On the next N lines, output a picture that can be painted with Josip's process and achieves the smallest
difference. The picture should be in the same format as in the input.</p>
<p>Note: The second part of the output (the picture) may not be unique. Any correct output will
be accepted.</p>
