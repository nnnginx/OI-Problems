Tom has again maths , and the teacher writes countless tables with exercises .... so boring. Then he remembers an old problem of informatics that he thought in a dream .


He remembered , he has a number of positive integers and the job was to know how many subsequences that have between L and U distinct elements exist in that range.
So the boring hour will pass quicker .

But he needs your help , he is to exhausted after two hours of math with the agitated teacher .
</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line of input file contains positive N, L, U. following N lines will contain a positive integer, each representing an element of the series.

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>
The first line of the output will display the number of sequences containing between L and U distinct elements.

</p><h3>Example</h3>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
4 1 2
231
19
7
19


<b>Output:</b>
8

<b>Notes:</b>

1&lt;= L &lt;= U &lt;= N &lt;= 2^20
The value of an item number is a positive integers [1,2^32-1];
A subsequence is a lot of items that appear on consecutive positions in the initial row.

Tom thanks you for solving this problem and he awards you with points.
