<p>Let there be given <em>n</em> points: P<sub>1</sub>,P<sub>2</sub>...,P<sub><em>n</em></sub> arranged in this order on a line. We would like to color them using four colors: white, black, red, and blue, in such a way that for every three consecutive points it is true that either <br> <strong>1.</strong> the colors of these three points are pairwise distinct, or <br> <strong>2.</strong> the color of some point is white.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>An integer <em>T</em>, denoting the number of testcases (<em>T</em>&lt;100000). In each line you are given one positive integer ( n&lt;1000000000 ). There are 5 input sets.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Find the number of possible colorings of the <em>n</em> points. Since the answer can be very big, output only the answer modulo 1000000007.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong><br>4<br>1<br>2<br>3<br>1000<br><br><strong>Output:</strong><br>4<br>16<br>43<br>283570349<br></pre>
<p><strong>Warning: large input/output data, be careful with certain languages </strong> <br><br></p>
<p><strong>Warning: A naive algorithm will probably solve only the first input set. </strong></p>
