<pre>Little John is playing very funny game with his younger brother. There  is 
one big box filled with M&amp;Ms of different colors. At first John has 
to eat several M&amp;Ms of the same color. Then his opponent has to make a turn. 
And so on. Please note that each player has to eat at least one M&amp;M 
during his turn. If John (or his brother) will eat the last M&amp;M from the 
box he will be considered as a looser and he will have to buy a new candy box. 

Both of players are using optimal game strategy. John starts first always. 
You will be given information about M&amp;Ms and your task is to determine a 
winner of such a beautiful game.
