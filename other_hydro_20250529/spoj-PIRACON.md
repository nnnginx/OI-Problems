<p>Humberto is a great Egyptian architect. In Egypt pyramid sculptural constructions were as common as ornaments. Pharaoh has asked Humberto to build N pyramids throughout Egypt. Humberto is very stingy when it comes to construction costs, so he always buys the exact necessary number of materials needed to complete his work.</p>
<p>Tural Pyramids are built using smallest pyramids of "level 1", that are used as building blocks for higher levels. Stacking pyramids of "level 1" to create higher-level structures, leave gaps. Special parts, called "Tringus", are used to cover these gaps. They are of triangular shape, designed by Humberto to perfectly fill the gaps on piramid sides.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../../../content/r_ranaldo:imagenPIRACON.jpeg" alt="" width="235" height="149"></p>
<p>For example, a pyramid of "Level 2" is constructed as follows: We are using a total of 6 pyramids of "level 1" (see the picture above). That leaves 4 gaps at the sides and we need 4 "Tringus" fo fill them. In total 10 pieces.</p>
<p>Humberto asks us to help to calculate the total number and "Tringus" number of pieces needed for a pyramid of level K.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains integer T, number of test cases. Following N lines, each containing an integer K, the level of the piramid.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>You must print "Pyramid&nbsp;E. Nro# i: ", followed by the total number of parts used (both pyramids of "level 1" and "Tringus").&nbsp;In the next line print "Tringus: ", followed by the number of "Tringus" used.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong><u>Input:</u></strong>
2
1
4

<strong><u>Output:</u></strong>
Pyramid E. Nro# 1: 1
Tringus: 0
Pyramid E. Nro# 2: 68
Tringus: 24
</pre>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
1&lt;= T &lt;= 10^4<br>
1&lt;= K &lt;= 10^6</p>
