<p>Consider a N*N*N lattice. One corner is at (0,0,0) and the opposite one is at (N,N,N). How many lattice points are visible from corner at (0,0,0) ? A point X is visible from point Y iff no other lattice point lies on the segment joining X and Y. <br>&nbsp;<br>Input : <br>The first line contains the number of test cases T. The next T lines contain an interger N <br>&nbsp;<br>Output : <br>Output T lines, one corresponding to each test case. <br>&nbsp;<br>Sample Input : <br>3 <br>1 <br>2 <br>5 <br>&nbsp;<br>Sample Output : <br>7 <br>19 <br>175 <br>&nbsp;<br>Constraints : <br>T &lt;= 50 <br>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000000</p>
