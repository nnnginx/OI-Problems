## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;�� the number of types of materials.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i\le 10^9$)&nbsp;�� the amount of each material $i$ that you currently hold.</p><p>The third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ ($0 \le b_i\le 10^9$)&nbsp;�� the amount of each material $i$ needed to produce the artifact.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. </p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print a single line containing either "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>", representing whether or not the artifact can be crafted.</p><p>You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yEs</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yes</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">Yes</span>", and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" will be recognized as positive responses.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, perform an operation on material $1$. After doing so, we will have exactly the required resources: $1$ unit of material $1$, and $4$ units each of materials $2$ and $3$.</p><p>In the second test case, it can be shown that no matter how the operations are performed, it is impossible to craft the artifact.</p><p>In the third test case, we can perform the operation on material $1$ twice. After these operations, we will have $3$ units of material $1$ and $8$ units of material $2$, which is more than enough to craft the artifact.</p>
