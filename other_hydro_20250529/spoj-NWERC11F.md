<h3>  Pool construction</h3>
<!--l. 3-->
<p>You are working for the International Company for Pool Construction, a construction company which specializes in building swimming pools. A new client wants to build several new pool areas. <!--l. 7--></p>
<p>A pool area is a rectangular grid of <em>w </em>¡Á <em>h </em>square patches, consisting of zero or more (possibly disconnected) pools. A pool consists of one or multiple connected hole patches, which will later be filled with water. In the beginning, you start with a piece of land where each patch is either a hole in the ground (¡¯.¡¯) or flat grass (¡¯#¡¯). In order to transform this land into a pool area, you must adhere to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can leave a patch as it is. This costs nothing. </li>
<li>If the patch is grass in the beginning, you can dig a hole there. This costs <em>d </em>EUR. </li>
<li>If the patch is a hole in the beginning, you can fill the hole and put grass on top.       This costs <em>f </em>EUR. </li>
<li>You <em>must </em>place special boundary elements along each edge running between a final       grass patch and a final hole patch, to ensure that water does not leak from the pool.       This costs <em>b </em>EUR per boundary element. </li>
<li>The outermost rows and columns of the pool area must always be grass.</li>
</ul>
<!--l. 26-->
<p>You are given the task of calculating the cost of the cheapest possible pool area given the layout of the existing piece of land. <!--l. 29--></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Input</h4>
<!--l. 30-->
<p>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul>
<li>one line with two integers <em>w </em>and <em>h </em>(2 ¡Ü <em>w,h </em>¡Ü 50): the width and height of the       building site. </li>
<li>one line with three integers <em>d</em>, <em>f </em>and <em>b </em>(1 ¡Ü <em>d,f,b </em>¡Ü 10<span style="margin-left:0.3em">&nbsp;000): the costs for digging a       new hole, filling an existing hole, and building a boundary element between a pool       and grass patch. </span></li>
<li><em>h </em>lines of <em>w </em>characters each, denoting the layout of the original building site.</li>
</ul>
<!--l. 43-->
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Output</h4>
<!--l. 44-->
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul>
<li>one line with an integer: the cost of building the cheapest possible pool area from       the original piece of land.</li>
</ul>
