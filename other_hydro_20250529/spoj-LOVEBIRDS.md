<p>Devo!&nbsp;<br>She has broken up with him again!<img title="Frown" src="../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-frown.gif" border="0" alt="Frown"></p>
<p>And after a series of break ups and patch ups , she is done with him!</p>
<p>Being a geek to keep herself distracted, she picks up her favourite topic of dynamic programming where she comes across this idiot problem which says</p>
<p>Given a integer N , you have to tell the sum of number of structurally unique Binary search trees built on different permutations of the set{x , x such &nbsp;that x belongs to [1,N] and x is an integer}.</p>
<p>A Binary Search tree is said to be built on a permutation iff the inorder traversal of that BST is same as the permutation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A permutation is said to be distinct from another &nbsp;if there exists a position i such that the i th &nbsp;element of both the permutations is different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, her inability to solve the problem is quite stressful to her!&nbsp;<br>Help her in Solving the problem! &nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: She observes that this number can be very large so output this number Modulo 1908 .</p>
<p>Morover she tells you that there inorder traversal of a Binary search tree is Unique.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input consists of T , the number of test cases.</p>
<p>The following T lines consists of a single integer N&nbsp;</p>
<p>(N can be at max 1000 , T can be at max 1000)</p>
<h3>Output&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You have to Output T lines each consisting of the answer to the problem Modulo 1908</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
