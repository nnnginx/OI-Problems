<p>This problem is about an imaginary game. First of all, define a <strong>War Board </strong>that is a <strong>N x N square matrix</strong>. Each matrix cell represents a warrior and the value written in the cell is the power of that particular warrior.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;"><br>Rules for assigning powers of each warrior</span> </strong></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1.</strong></span> First start filling the main diagonal with numbers <strong>1, 2, 3, 4 .... K</strong> according to requirement. Starting of filling always be at the top corner.<br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2.</span></strong> Now start filling the anti diagonal with numbers <strong>k + 1, k + 2, k + 3, k + 4 .... L</strong> according to requirement. Starting of filling always be at the bottom&nbsp;corner. <strong>Don't forget that in case of filling the anti diagonal if there is any number already filled it will be modified by the current number&nbsp;that is to be filled, if that particular cell was empty</strong>.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3.</strong></span> Now fill all the empty cells, in <strong>anti-clockwise spiral</strong> filling manner. The first cell to be filled will be <strong>2nd last column of first row</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Description of game</strong></span></span><br>The greatest warrior <strong>W</strong> of king Pushyamitra Shunga is having fight with Yavana warriors. W fights with one Yavana warrior <strong>Y</strong> at a time. Consider the followings<br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">1.</span></strong> <strong>Power_of_W is more than Yavanas</strong>.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>2.</strong></span> W can defeat Y if <strong>Power_of_W &gt; Power_of_Y - 1</strong><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3.</strong></span> After each win <strong>Power_of_W decreases by Power_of_Y</strong><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">4.</span></strong> W can move to cells adjacent to it. If <strong>Current_Cell_Location_of_W</strong> is <strong>(i, j)</strong> then<br><strong>Next_Cell_Location_of_W</strong> will be one of <strong>(i ¡À 1, j ¡À 1)</strong> or <strong>(i ¡À 1, j) </strong>or <strong>(i, j ¡À 1) </strong><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>5.</strong></span> W will win if W defeats Y such that <strong>Power_of_Y = 1</strong>, otherwise W is defeated.<br><br><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What to code<br></strong></span></span>You have to code to verify whether W wins or get defeated but don't forget the followings -<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1.</strong></span> The one cell location is of W and other cell locations are of Yavanas<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>2.</strong></span> Its up to W to choose the Yavana warrior Y to fight with<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3.</strong></span> Its not necessary that W has to defeat all Yavanas, <strong>W just want to win</strong></p>
