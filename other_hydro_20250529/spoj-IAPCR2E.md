<p>You have w white, r red, g green and b blue balloons. To make a single student happy you need exactly four balloons. All four balloons given to a student shouldn't have the same color. What is the maximum number S of happy students if we know number of balloons of each color?</p>
<p>Your task is to write a program that for given values w,r, g and b will find the  S.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input starts with an integer T (≤ 20000), denoting the number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each test case contains four integers w,r, g and b (0 ≤ w,r, g, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of white,red, green and blue balloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case print a single integer S — maximum number of happy students.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2
2 2 1 3
1 1 4 1

<strong>Output:</strong>
Case 1: 2
Case 2: 1
