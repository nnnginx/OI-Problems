<p>Alice and Bob need to send secret messages to each other and are discussing ways to encode their
messages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
	<u>Alice:</u> ��Let��s just use a very simple code: We��ll assign ��A�� the code word 1, ��B�� will be 2,
	and so on down to ��Z�� being assigned 26.��<br></p>
<p>
	<u>Bob:</u> ��That��s a stupid code, Alice. Suppose I send you the word ��BEAN�� encoded as 25114.
	You could decode that in many different ways!��<br>
</p>
<p>
	<u>Alice:</u> ��Sure you could, but what words would you get? Other than ��BEAN��, you��d get
	��BEAAD��, ��YAAD��, ��YAN��, ��YKD�� and ��BEKD��. I think you would be able to figure out the
	correct decoding. And why would you send me the word ��BEAN�� anyway?��<br>
</p>
<p>
	<u>Bob:</u> ��OK, maybe that��s a bad example, but I bet you that if you got a string of length 5000
	there would be tons of different decodings and with that many you would find at least two
	different ones that would make sense.��<br>
</p>
<p>
	<u>Alice:</u> ��How many different decodings?��<br>
</p>
<p>
	<u>Bob:</u> ��Jillions!��
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For some reason, Alice is still unconvinced by Bob��s argument, so she requires a program that will
determine how many decodings there can be for a given string using her code.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input will consist of multiple input sets. Each set will consist of a single line of at most 5000 digits representing a
valid encryption (for example, no line will begin with a 0). There will be no spaces between the digits.
An input line of ��0�� will terminate the input and should not be processed.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each input set, output the number of possible decodings for the input string. All answers will be
within the range of a 64 bit signed integer.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><b>Input:</b>

25114
1111111111
3333333333

<b>Output:</b>
