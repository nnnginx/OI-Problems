</p><p>The traffic network in a country consists of N cities (labeled with integers from 1 to N) and N-1 roads connecting the cities. There is a unique path between each pair of different cities, and we know the exact length of each road. </p>
<p>Write a program that will, for each of the K given pairs of cities, find the length of the shortest and the length of the longest road on the path between the two cities. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer N, 2 �� N �� 100 000. Each of the following N-1 lines contains three integers A, B and C meaning that there is a road of length C between city A and city B. </p>
<p>The length of each road will be a positive integer less than or equal to 1 000 000. <br>
The next line contains an integer K, 1 �� K �� 100 000. Each of the following K lines contains two different integers D and E �C the labels of the two cities constituting one query. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Output</h3>
<p>Each of the K lines of output should contain two integers �C the lengths from the task description for the corresponding pair of the cities. </p>
