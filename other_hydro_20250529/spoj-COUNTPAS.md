<p>Pascal’s triangle is a common figure in combinatorics. It is a triangle formed by rows of integers.<br>The top row contains a single 1. Each new row has one element more than the previous one<br>and is formed as follows: the leftmost and rightmost values are 1, while each of the other values<br>is the sum of the two values above it. Here we depict the first 7 rows of the triangle.</p>

<p>Pascal’s triangle is infinite, of course, and contains the value 1 an unbounded number of times.<br>However, any other value appears a finite number of times in the triangle. In this problem you<br>are given an integer K ≥ 2. Your task is to calculate the number of values in the triangle that<br>are different from 1 and less than or equal to K.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains<br>an integer K (2 ≤ K ≤ 10<sup>9</sup> ). The last line of the input contains a single −1 and should not be<br>processed as a test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line with an integer indicating the number of values in Pascal’s<br>triangle that are different from 1 and less than or equal to K.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2<br>6<br>-1<br><br><strong>Output:</strong><br>1<br>10</pre>
