## Description

You are given two sequences $\{a_i\}$ and $\{b_i\}$ of length $n$, and the element of them are indexed from $1$ to $n$. You need to choose $K$ numbers in each sequence, and ensure that at least $L$ positions are chosen in both sequences. Your task is to maximize the sum of the $2K$ numbers.

Formally speaking, you need to assign $2$ sequences $\{c_i\}$ and $\{d_i\}$ of length $K$ such that 

+ $1 \leq c_1 < c_2 < \cdots < c_K \leq n$
+ $1 \leq d_1 < d_2 < \cdots < d_K \leq n$
+ $\left\lvert\{c_1, c_2, \cdots, c_K\} \cap \{d_1, d_2, \cdots, d_K\}\right\rvert \geq L$

Your goal is to maximize
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{K}{a_{c_i}} + \sum_{i=1}^{K}{b_{d_i}}
$$

## Input

The first line contains a single integer $T$ ¡ª the number of test cases.

Each test case contains $3$ lines.

The first line contains $3$ integers $n, K, L$.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n$.

The third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \cdots, b_n$.

## Output

For each test case, print a single integer ¡ª the maximal sum.

## Limits And Hints

For all of the tests, $T \leq 10$, $1 \leq \sum{n} \leq 10^6$, $1 \leq L \leq K \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5$, $1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9$.
