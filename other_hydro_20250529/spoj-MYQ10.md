<p>Given two numbers a and b, find the number of mirror numbers in between them (inclusive of a and b).<br></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains T, number of testcases &lt;= 10^5.<br>Each testcase is described in a single line containing two numbers a and b.<br><br>0 &lt;= a&lt;=b &lt;= 10^44</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case print the number of mirror numbers between a and b in a single line.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
3<br>0 10<br>10 20<br>1 4

<strong>Output:</strong>
