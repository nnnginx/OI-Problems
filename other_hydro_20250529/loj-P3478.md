We call those numbers satisfying that numbers on all digits are the same as Beautiful Numbers of type $1$.

Additionally, we define Beautiful Numbers of type $2$ as those satisfying any of the following conditions:

- Is a beautiful number of type I.
- Assume this is a number with $t$ digits and no prefix zeros, then the numbers on $t-1$ digits are the same.

Now you are given a value $x$ and your task is to find the first Beautiful Number of type $k+1$ which satisfies $\geq x$.


## Input Format

The first line consists of a single integer $x$.
