<p>
Factorial numbers are getting big very soon, you'll have to compute the number of divisors of such highly composite numbers.</p>


<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer <em>T</em>, the number of test cases.<br>
On the next <em>T</em> lines, you will be given two integers <em>N</em> and <em>M</em>.<br>
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output <em>T</em> lines, one for each test case, with the number of divisors of the factorial of <em>N</em>.<br>
Since the answer can get very big, output it modulo <em>M</em>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Input:</b>
3
2 1000
3 11
4 5
<b>Output:</b>
2
4
3
</pre>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<pre>0 &lt; T &lt; 5432
1 &lt; N &lt; 10^8
1 &lt; M &lt; 10^9
</pre>
<p>
For N, M : uniform random input in the range.<br>
One input file.<br>
</p>

<h3>Information</h3>
<p>As it is possible to solve DIVFACT2 with fast language and intermediate method, here is the hard edition. <br>
<strong>Warning :</strong> It could be very hard or impossible to solve this problem with slow languages.<br>
Time limit is approx ¡Á4 my unoptimized C_time. Good luck and have fun ;-)  (Edit 2017-02-11 ; TL updated ; compiler changes)
