<p>Jozo the glazier has once again made N square pieces&nbsp;of glass. The dimensions (sides) of these squares are equal to 1, 2, 3, ..., N - therefore, the areas of these squares equal to 1<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 3<sup>2</sup>, ..., N<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Four customers have arrived once again. This time Jozo will sell all N squares of glass. Again, each of the customers must get the same total area of glass (which equals the total area of all N squares divided by four).</p>
<p>Help Jozo and divide his N pieces of glass among the four customers. Assume that the solution (not necesarily unique) exists in all of the test data.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>An integer N (10 ¡Ü N ¡Ü 60).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>In the first line, print four numbers: the number of pieces of glass assigned to the first, to the second, to the third and to the fourth customer (respectively).</p>
<p>In i<sup>th</sup> of the next four lines, print the dimensions of the squares of glass assigned to the i<sup>th</sup> customer. (Each square must be assigned to exactly one customer.)</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
15

<strong>Output:</strong>
<pre style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px;">4 4 4 3
