<p>Given n points in a plane find the diameter of the smallest circle that encloses all the points. A point lying on the circle is also considered to be inside it</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of input contains the n (&lt;301) the number of points in the plane , followed by n lines of input<br>Each line gives the coordinates of one point on the plane. Each coordinate is an integer in the range [0,1000]</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output consists of a single real number, the diameter of the circle rounded to two decimal places.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
