## Description

You are given some positive integers. Please print them as is.

## Hint

This problem aims at testing file input and output. **Please do file IO with the specified file name** rather than operating standard IO.

Hover the mouse onto the <span class="ui orange label"><i aria-hidden="true" class="file icon"></i>File IO</span> icon to view file name.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains the number of test cases $ T $.

Then come $ T $ lines, with one integer per line.



## Output

Print $ T $ lines with the corresponding integer at every line.

```input1
3
1
2
3
```

```output1
1
2
3
```

```input2
1
1000000000000000000000000000000000
```

```output2
1000000000000000000000000000000000
```

## Data Limits

For all subtasks, $ 1 \leq T \leq 10, 1 \leq a \leq 10 ^ {1000} $.

**Subtask 1** (10 Points) $ 1 \leq a \leq 3 $;  
**Subtask 2** (20 Points) $ 1 \leq a \leq 100000 $;  
**Subtask 3** (70 Points) has no additional limitations.
