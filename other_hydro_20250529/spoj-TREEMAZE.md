<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">Yesterday my nephew visited me and we played with lego. We decided to create castle with maze.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">We took board of 5 x 5 and created different mazes. We decided that we need perfect maze - One that has minimum lego pieces, but there should be exactly one path between each pair of cells without lego.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">We quickly find out that we need just 6 pieces and build all 22 configurations using them</div>

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>Yesterday my nephew visited me and we played with lego.</p>
<p>We took board of 5 x 5 and created different mazes. We decided that we need perfect maze - One that has minimum lego pieces, but there should be exactly one path between each pair of cells without lego.</p>
<p>We quickly found out that we needed just 6 pieces and built all 22 configurations using them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of them:</p>

<p><img src="../../content/defrager:maze5x5.png" alt="Maze" width="608" height="224"></p>
<p>But then he took his board of 13 x 13 and said - let's build perfect maze here!</p>
<p>Now we have no idea how many pieces we need and how many configurations we should build. Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<p>Two numbers - number of single lego pieces we need to build perfect maze on 13x13 board&nbsp;and number of configurations of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
