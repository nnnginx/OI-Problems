<p>Ben and Gwen gets two bag of chocolate from grandpa. Ben¡¯s bag contain X1 kit-Kat and Y1 Park chocolate. Gwen¡¯s bag contain X2 kit-Kat and Y2 Park. But Ben don¡¯t like chocolate, so he decided to give all the chocolate to Gwen. But he want to play a game with Gwen. The game is very simple, and if Gwen win the game he will give all the chocolate to Gwen. The game follow those rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>First Ben take a chocolate from his bag &amp;it will be unknown to Gwen</li>
<li>Then he placed the chocolate to Gwen bag</li>
<li>Then Gwen take a chocolate form her bag</li>
<li>If Gwen take chocolate is same as Ben chocolate then she win the game and get all the chocolate from Ben.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, Find out the probability of Gwen win in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<p>Input starts with an integer T (¡Ü 100), denoting the number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each line contain four integer x1,y1,x2,y2 which denotes ben chocolate and Gwen chocolate respectively. Where 0¡Üx1,y1,x2,y2¡Ü1000000</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For each test case print the case number and Gwen win probability in a/b format. where a/b is irreducible fraction. if any case probability cames zero, just print ¡®0¡¯ (Case x: 0).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
