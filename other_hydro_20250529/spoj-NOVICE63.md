<p>Ted thinks that integers having equal number of 1's and 0's in their binary representation are special. Therefore, he wants to know how many such integers are present.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;For this problem, the binary representation of an integer(&gt;0) is considered from the least significant bit to the last set bit.       Which means, 5 has a binary representation of 101, 3 has a binary representation of 11 etc.        As such, one example of a special number is 9 which has a binary representation, 1001.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains an integer T(atmost 100) denoting the total number of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer N(2 &lt;= N &lt;= 2^60).  N is always a power of 2.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>A single integer denoting the total number of such special numbers in the range 1 to N (inclusive).</p>
