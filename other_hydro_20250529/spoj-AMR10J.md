<p>There are N bottles each having a different chemical. For each chemical i, you have determined C[i] which means that mixing chemicals i and C[i] causes an explosion. You have K distinct boxes. In how many ways can you divide the N chemicals into those boxes such that no two chemicals in the same box can cause an explosion together? <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>INPUT</strong><br>The first line of input is the number of test cases T. T test cases follow each containing 2 lines. <br>The first line of each test case contains 2 integers N and K. <br>The second line of each test case contains N integers, the ith integer denoting the value C[i]. The chemicals are numbered from 0 to N-1. <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>OUTPUT</strong> <br>For each testcase, output the number of ways modulo 1,000,000,007. <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>CONSTRAINTS </strong><br>T &lt;= 50 <br>2 &lt;= N &lt;= 100 <br>2 &lt;= K &lt;= 1000 <br>0 &lt;= C[i] &lt; N <br>For all i, i != C[i] <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>SAMPLE INPUT </strong><br>3 <br>3 3 <br>1 2 0 <br>4 3 <br>1 2 0 0 <br>3 2 <br>1 2 0 <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>SAMPLE OUTPUT </strong><br>6 <br>12 <br>0 <br>&nbsp;<br><strong>EXPLANATION </strong><br>In the first test case, we cannot mix any 2 chemicals. Hence, each of the 3 boxes must contain 1 chemical, which leads to 6 ways in total. <br>In the third test case, we cannot put the 3 chemicals in the 2 boxes satisfying all the 3 conditions.</p>
