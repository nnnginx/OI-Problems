## 题目描述


Little Petya likes integers. Recently he has learned about different properties of sums of number's digits. For example, if the sum of number's digits is divisible by $9$ , then the number itself is divisible by $9$ as well.

Now little Petya is interested in numbers with equal sum of digits. He asks his older brother Dima to find $n$ positive integers with equal sum of digits and minimal possible total sum. Dima has other important things to do, so he asked you to write a program that solves this problem for him.



## 输入格式


Input file contains a single integer $n (1 \le n \le 5000)$ .



## 输出格式


Output the minimal possible sum of $n$ positive integers, that all have same sum of digits.



## 题目大意
输入一个整数n，要求找到n个不同的正整数，使得这n个正整数**数位和**一样且总和最小，输出这个总和  
**数位和**：一个数每一位的值的和，比如123的数位和为1+2+3=6  

样例一解释：选择了1和10两个数  
样例二解释：选择了2，11和20这三个数

```input1
2

```

```output1
11

```

```input2
3

```

```output2
33

```
