<p>Imagine an infinite table with rows and columns numbered using the natural numbers. The following figure shows a procedure to traverse such a table assigning a consecutive natural number to each table cell:

<p><br>
This enumeration of cells can be used to represent complex data types using natural numbers:

</p><p><br>
</p><ul>
<li>A pair of natural numbers (i, j) is represented by the number corresponding to the cell in row i and column j. For instance, the pair (3,2) is represented by the natural number 17; this fact is noted by P2(3, 2) = 17.

<p><br>
</p></li><li>The pair representation can be used to represent n-tuples. A triplet (a, b, c) is represented by P2(a, P2(b, c)). A 4-tuple (a, b, c, d) is represented by P2(a, P2(b, P2(c, d))). This procedure can be generalized for an arbitrary n:

<p><br>
</p><center>Pn(a1, ..., an) = P2(a1, Pnâˆ’1(a2, .., an)),</center>

<p><br>
where Pn denotes the n-tuple representation function, n &gt;=  2. For example P3(2, 0, 1) = 12.

</p><p><br>
</p></li><li>A list of arbitrary length ha1, ..., ani is represented by
</li></ul>

<p><br>
</p><center>L(ha1, ..., ani) = P2(n, Pn(a1, ..., an)).</center>

<p><br>
For example, L(h0, 1i) = 12.

</p><p><br>
The Association of Convex Makers (ACM) uses this clever enumeration scheme in a polygon representation system. The system can represent a polygon, defined by integer coordinates, using a natural number as follows: given a polygon defined by a vertex sequence h(x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn)i assign the natural number:

</p><p><br>
</p><center>L((hP2(x1, y1), ..., P2(xn, yn))).

<p><br>
ACM needs a program that, given a natural numbers that represents a polygon, calculates the area of the polygon. It is guaranteed that the given polygon is a simple one, i.e. its sides do not intersect.

</p><p><br>
As an example of the problem, the triangle with vertices at (1,1), (2,0) and (0,0) is codified with the number 2141. The area of this triangle is 1.

</p><h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case is given in a single line of the input by a natural number representing a polygon. The end of the test cases is indicated with *.

</p><p><br>
</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>One line per test case, preserving the input order. Each output line contains a decimal number telling the area of the corresponding encoded polygon. Areas must be printed with 1 decimal place, truncating less significative decimal places.
