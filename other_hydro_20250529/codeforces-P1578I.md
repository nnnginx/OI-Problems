## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">This is an interactive problem.</span></p><p>Your goal is to find a circle on a plane by shooting rays and getting the distance to the circle as a result. </p><p>Interactor has three hidden integer parameters that are determined in advance for each test, but which you don't know ¡ª $x_c$, $y_c$, and $r_c$. $(x_c, y_c)$ are coordinates of the circle's center and $r_c$ is its radius. The absolute values of $x_c$, $y_c$, and $r_c$ do not exceed $10^5$, and $1 \leq r_c \leq \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} - 1$.</p><p>You can shoot rays that extend from the origin $(0,0)$ and go via a point $(x_q,y_q)$ with the integer coordinates you specify. For each ray, you get a distance from the ray to the circle or $0$ if the ray intersects the circle. </p></div><div><h2>Interaction</h2><p>The interaction starts with your program printing a query to the standard output and finishes when your program finds and prints the answer to the problem.</p><p>Each query has a form of "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">? $x_q$ $y_q$</span>", where $x_q$ and $y_q$ are integers ($|x_q|, |y_q| \le 10^6$; $x_q \ne 0$ or $y_q \ne 0$). </p><p>The interactor outputs a line with a single floating-point number ¡ª the distance between a query ray and a circle that is precise to $10^{-10}$ by an absolute value.</p><p>Your program can make the next query, read the output, and so on. You are allowed to do at most $60$ queries. At the end of the interaction, print the answer line "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">! $x_c$ $y_c$ $r_c$</span>", flush the output and exit.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Note, that the output of the interactor is actually rounded to the 10-th digit after a decimal point, so if you are stress-testing your solution locally, make sure that you also perform the corresponding rounding.</span></p></div>
