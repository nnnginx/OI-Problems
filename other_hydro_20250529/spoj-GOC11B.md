<p>Sanvi is very busy girl. So you have been given enough time  (1000 milliseconds) to help him.</p>
<p><br> Sanvi has a bag of marbles with different alphabets written on them.   And she has become busy on playing with these marbles by putting them in N   boxes placed in a row. There are exactly M distinct type of marbles, N   of each type.<br><br> Now she puts only N marbles (out of M*N) in N  boxes, one by one and upon  completion she writes down the letters on the  marbles on a paper to form a  string. As Sanvi hates palindrome strings  (strings which read same from  both sides e.g. MADAM), she erases  palindrome string from the paper as  soon as he finds one.<br><br> Now she is wondering how many different strings she might get on her paper  if she could try all possible combination of putting the marbles in the   boxes. So you have to help her by answering. As there could be many   strings so print it modulo 1,000,000,007.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input starts with an integer TC(&lt;=10), denoting the number of test cases. Each  case starts with two non negative integers N(&lt;=100000) and M(&lt;=26) as described above.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case, print the case number and total number of strings written on the paper modulo 1000000007.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
2<br>2 2<br>2 3
<strong>Output:</strong>
Case 1: 2 <br>Case 2: 6
