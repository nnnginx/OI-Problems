<p>You are given a triangle and a circle in a plane. You can arbitrarily rotate or move them. What's the maximum possible area of their overlapping region?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input consists of one or more lines. For each line, there are four integers describing one test case: the lengths of three sides of a triangle <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>; and the radius of a circle <em>r</em>; where 1&lt;= <em>a</em> &lt;= <em>b</em> &lt;= <em>c</em> &lt;= 100, 1&lt;= <em>r</em> &lt;= 100, <em>a+b&gt;c </em>.</p>
<p>End of input is indicated by a line consisting four zeros.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single line showing the largest overlapping area of the circle and the triangle. We accept solutions with absolute error less than 10<sup>-2</sup>.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong>
3 4 5 1
5 5 8 4
0 0 0 0

<strong>Output:</strong>
