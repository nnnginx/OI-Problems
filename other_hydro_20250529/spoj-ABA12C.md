<p>Harish went to a supermarket to buy exactly ��k�� kilograms apples for his ��n�� friends. The supermarket was really weird. The pricing of items was very different. He went to the Apples section and enquired about the prices. The salesman gave him a card in which he found that the prices of apples were not per kg. The apples were packed into covers, each containing ��x�� kg of apples, x &gt; 0 and ��x�� is an integer. An ��x�� kg packet would be valued at ��y�� rupees. So, the placard contained a table with an entry ��y�� denoting the price of an ��x�� kg packet. If ��y�� is -1 it means that the corresponding packet is not available. Now as apples are available only in packets, he decides to buy atmost ��n�� packets for his ��n�� friends i.e he will not buy more than n packets of apples.</p>
