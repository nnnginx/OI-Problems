<p>Akash has recenty joined a new company and on his first day at office his colleague Mr. Goyal (who is always ready to mock him :XD) gave him an interesting problem to solve.</p>
<p>Assume <strong>N</strong> beggars, numbered from 1 to<strong> N</strong> are standing outside a temple. It is given that '<strong>k</strong>' people visit the temple on that partucular day.</p>
<p>Every person who comes out of the temple selects some beggars from <strong>'l' to 'r'</strong> and gives each beggar from <strong>'l' to 'r'</strong> 1$ each.</p>
<p>The task is to find out the beggar (or beggars) who gets the maximum amount of money at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Akash does not want to get insulted on the first day, so he has asked you to help him.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the number of beggars.</p>
<p>The second line contains an integer 'k' denoting the number of people who visit the temple.</p>
<p>Each of the next k lines contains two integers 'l' and 'r'.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The first line of output contains the maximum amount of money a beggar gets.</p>
<p>The next line consists the beggars who get the maximum amount of money at the end of the day.</p>
