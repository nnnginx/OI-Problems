## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$), the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$, $n-1\leq m\leq \min(2\cdot 10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2})$) ！ the number of nodes and edges respectively.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1\ldots, v_n$ ($-10^9 \leq v_i \leq 10^9$) ！ initial values of nodes.</p><p>The third line contains $n$ integers $t_1\ldots, t_n$ ($-10^9 \leq t_i \leq 10^9$) ！ target values of nodes.</p><p>Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $i$ and $j$ representing an edge between node $i$ and node $j$ ($1 \leq i, j \leq n$, $i\ne j$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there is at most one edge between the same pair of nodes.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all testcases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ and the sum of $m$ over all testcases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, if it is possible for every node to reach its target after some number of operations, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>". Otherwise, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>".</p>

## Note

<p>Here is a visualization of the first test case (the orange values denote the initial values and the blue ones the desired values): </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="./32173/file/1AuaaAw7.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>One possible order of operations to obtain the desired values for each node is the following:</p><ul> <li> Operation $1$: Add $2$ to nodes $2$ and $3$. </li><li> Operation $2$: Add $-2$ to nodes $1$ and $4$. </li><li> Operation $3$: Add $6$ to nodes $3$ and $4$. </li></ul><p>Now we can see that in total we added $-2$ to node $1$, $2$ to node $2$, $8$ to node $3$ and $4$ to node $4$ which brings each node exactly to it's desired value.</p><p>For the graph from the second test case it's impossible to get the target values.</p>
