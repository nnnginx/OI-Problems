After trying to solve Problem Number 31 (Fast Multiplication) with some script languages that support arbitrary large integers and timing out, you wonder what would be the best language to do fast multiplication of integers.
And naturally it comes to your mind: Of course it is brainf**k, because there are only very cheap operations in that language.
