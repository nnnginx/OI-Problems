<p>A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors 
other than 1 and itself.</p>

<p>we define here a new prime number called prime of primes number (POP) is 
a prime number that consist of other prime numbers less than this number.</p>

<p><strong>example:</strong></p>

<p>1013 consist of 101 and 3 and both are primes.</p>

<p><strong>notes</strong>:</p>

<p>2003 is not POP because leading zero not allowed.</p>
<p>The POP number must contain more than or equal two primes, and overlapping not allowed.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases (T &lt;= 200) followed by&nbsp;T lines,
each line contains an integer m number 0 &lt;=m &lt;= 10^27.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print a single line containing the first integer greater than or equal to m and is (POP).</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
