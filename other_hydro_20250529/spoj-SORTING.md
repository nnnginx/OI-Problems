<p><strong>For those who don't know that brainfuck is a programming language: Take a look at the <a href="http://www.esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/impl/compilers/BF2C.c">converter to C</a>. It will ignore every unknown command, therefore submitting a program in any other language won't necessarily lead to compile error, but certainly not to Accepted.</strong></p>
