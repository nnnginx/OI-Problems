<p><b>N</b> large empty boxes (assume they are of type:1) are initially placed on a table. An unknown number of 
boxes (type:1) are selected and in each of
them <b>K</b> smaller boxes (type:2) are placed.
Again an unknown number of type:2 boxes are selected and <b>K</b> boxes of type:3 are placed inside. This process is repeated
<b>T</b> times. Now a box is assumed to be empty when it has no smaller boxes inside it. Finally after all the 
processes are complete let there be <b>F</b> empty boxes in total.

</p><h3>LIMITS</h3>
1&lt; N, K, T, F &lt;1000000

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of the input file contains the number of test cases. Then each line contains 4 integers N, K, T, F as described
above.

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>Each line should contain the total number of boxes on the table.
