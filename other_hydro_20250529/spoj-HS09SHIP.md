<p>You are traveling by starship and at any time you are always moving in one of <strong>6</strong> directions: forwards, backwards, up, down, left, or right. In other words, during every second, one of the three coordinates of your position changes by exactly one unit. Let us suppose that you are at (<strong>x</strong><sub>1</sub>,<strong>y</strong><sub>1</sub>,<strong>z</strong><sub>1</sub>) and you would like to reach (<strong>x</strong><sub>2</sub>,<strong>y</strong><sub>2</sub>,<strong>z</strong><sub>2</sub>). Unfortunately, yours is only a first generation starship, which means that all movements are completely random, so at every second you will be moving with probability 1/6 forwards/backwards/up/down/left/right. Could you compute the probability that we will be at the destination in the <strong>n-</strong>th second?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains integer <strong>T</strong>, representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, the next line gives the starting position of the starship, while the final one is the destination. It is known that: <strong>T</strong>&lt;30000, <strong>0</strong>&lt;n&lt;=1000. The absolute value of the <strong>x,y,z</strong> coordinates are smaller than 10<sup>6</sup>. There are <strong>5</strong> input sets for <strong>10</strong> points.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output</p>
<p><strong>T</strong> lines, and in the <strong>i</strong>-th line give the required probability for the <strong>i</strong>-th test case. Use <strong>10 </strong>digits after the decimal point!</p>
