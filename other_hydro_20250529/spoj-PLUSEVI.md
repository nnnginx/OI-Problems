<p>Mirko is a strange boy so he has written down a square matrix full of ones and zeroes. Now he is interested in how many plusses there are in his matrix.</p>
<p>A plus is a square such that its side has an odd length greater than 1 and all of its cells are zero, except for the middle row and the middle column: they must be full of ones. For example, in the matrix below there are two plusses, one inside the other:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">00100<br>00100<br>11111<br>00100<br>00100</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>In the first line there is an integer N ¡Ü 2000, dimenzion of the square matrix.</p>
<p>The next N lines are the rows of the matrix.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print the number of plusses appearing in the matrix.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
