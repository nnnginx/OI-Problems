## Description

Well, that certainly didn’t go as planned: While you managed to avoid the museum’s watchmen, you somehow missed that there were surveillance cameras all over the place. As a consequence, your debut as an art thief turned out to be a total disaster: You were arrested and sentenced to prison.

Because WiFi access in prison is _the worst_, you want to escape. From many prison dramas, you know that distractions are crucial to any escape plan. Therefore, you decided to set up a prison rebellion as a ploy.

The $𝑁$ prison cells are aligned along a single hallway. The leftmost cell is number $1$, the cell immediately to its right is number $2$, and so on. Unfortunately, not all your fellow prisoners join the rebellion as planned. But you could make sure that the prisoner in cell $𝑖$ is planning to start rebelling at time $t_i$,i.e. exactly $t_i$ seconds from now. Also, whenever a prisoner hears the prisoner immediately to _his left_ rebelling, he will also start rebelling after just one second (unless he is already rebelling, of course).A prisoner who has started rebelling will never stop.

At time $T$,  the local F.R.U.IT.T.Ar.T. representative will arrive for an inspection. You figure that this will be the perfect time to escape. However, the prison wardens won’t be happy about a rebellion during an inspection. You are afraid they are going to use $𝐷$ soundproof mattresses that can be installed between cells. If such a mattress is installed between cell $𝑖 − 1$ and cell $𝑖$, the prisoner in cell $𝑖$ will not start rebelling before time $t_i$ regardless of the actions of the prisoner in cell 𝑖 − 1 (or any other prisoner).

Write a program that helps you estimate your chances of success: The program shall compute the minimal number of prisoners who will rebel at time $𝑇$ if the wardens place the mattresses optimally.

## Input

The first line of input contains three integers $𝑁$, $𝐷$, and $𝑇$: the number of prison cells, the number of mattresses, and the time the representative arrives.

The second line contains $𝑁$ integers $t_i$, where $t_i$ describes the time the prisoner in cell $𝑖$ is planning to start rebelling.

## Output

The only line of output should consist of exactly one integer: the minimal number of prisoners rebelling at time $𝑇$.

```input1
5 1 42
13 37 47 11 42

```input2

## Limits And Hints

We always have $1 \le D<N \le 2 \times 10^6$, $1 \le T,t_i \le 10^9$.

- Subtask 1(15 points): $N \le 500$.
- Subtask 2(10 points): $N \le 5 \times 10^5$, $D=1$.
- Subtask 3(20 points): $N \le 4000$.
- Subtask 4(10 points): $N \le 7.5 \times 10^4$, $D \le 15$.
- Subtask 5(25 pts): $N \le 7.5 \times 10^4$.
- Subtask 6(20 pts): No further constraints.
