<p>Štef lives in a house located in (0, 0). His girlfriend Barica lives in a house located in (X, Y).</p>
<p>Štef likes walking, so he decided to walk for exactly N hours (starting from his house) and finish his route at Barica's house.</p>
<p>Each hour, Štef moves from his current position to one of the four adjacent positions (north, south, east or west).</p>
<p>Help Štef and calculate how manny possible routes there are. (If there isn't any, print 0.)</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>In the first line there is an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup><span>).</span></p>
<p>In the second line there are integers X, Y separated by a space (-N ≤ X, Y ≤ N).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Calculate the number of possible Štef's routes from (0, 0) to (X, Y) that last for exactly N hours. Print the result modulo 500 000 003.</p>
