<p><strong><em>[Due to SPOJ restrictions, this problem has been modified with respect to the original version used in the Argentinian Programming Tournament of 2014 in order to have multiple test cases per input file. The original version of this problem (in Spanish) can be found at <a title="http://dc.uba.ar/events/icpc/download/problems/tap2014-problems.pdf" href="http://dc.uba.ar/events/icpc/download/problems/tap2014-problems.pdf">http://dc.uba.ar/events/icpc/download/problems/tap2014-problems.pdf</a> ]</em></strong></p>
<p>Throughout history many different numbering systems have been developed. Some, like Roman numerals, have now been almost completely abandoned due to their lack of convenience. Other even more exotic numbering systems are only ever used in certain applications, such as the factoradic numbers in the context of permutation numbering. In this problem we will consider a numbering system known as <em>balanced base-3</em>, which naturally appears in the analysis of diverse mathematical problems related to balance scales.</p>
<p>The balanced base-3 system is similar to the decimal or <em>base-10</em> system we are familiar with in that it is <em>positional</em>. Positional numbering systems have <em>digits</em> whose relative order determines which power of the <em>base </em>accompanies them. For example, in base-10 we have</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">123 = <strong>1</strong>¡Á10<sup>2</sup> + <strong>2</strong>¡Á10<sup>1</sup> + <strong>3</strong>¡Á10<sup>0</sup>.</p>
<p>In standard positional systems, the allowed digits are the numbers from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>B-1</strong>, where <strong>B</strong> is the base of the corresponding system. Therefore, the number <strong>123 </strong>in base-10 is written in standard base-3 as <strong>"<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">11120</span>"</strong> because</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1</strong>¡Á3<sup>4</sup> + <strong>1</strong>¡Á3<sup>3</sup> + <strong>1</strong>¡Á3<sup>2</sup> + <strong>2</strong>¡Á3<sup>1</sup> + <strong>0</strong>¡Á3<sup>0</sup> = 123.</p>
<p>Balanced base-3 is different from standard base-3 only in the fact that the allowed digits are <strong>0</strong>, <strong>1</strong> and <strong>-1</strong>, which we will respectively denote as <strong>'<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">0</span>'</strong>, <strong>'<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">+</span>'</strong> and <strong>'<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">-</span>'</strong>. Then, the number <strong>123 </strong>in base-10 is written as <strong>"<span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">+----0</span>"</strong> in balanced base-3, for we have</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1</strong>¡Á3<sup>5</sup> + (<strong>-1</strong>)¡Á3<sup>4</sup> + (<strong>-1</strong>)¡Á3<sup>3</sup> + (<strong>-1</strong>)¡Á3<sup>2</sup> + (<strong>-1</strong>)¡Á3<sup>1</sup> + <strong>0</strong>¡Á3<sup>0</sup> = 123.</p>
<p>Conversion from numbers in base-10 to balanced base-3 is a mechanical and somewhat tedious process, so we require a program to do it for us. Can you help?</p>
