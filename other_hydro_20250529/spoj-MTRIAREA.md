<p>Given n distinct points on a plane, your task is to ﬁnd the triangle that  have the maximum area, whose vertices are from the given points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. The ﬁrst line of each test case  contains an integer n, indicating the number of points on the plane. Each of  the following n lines contains two integer xi and yi, indicating the ith points.  The last line of the input is an integer −1, indicating the end of input,  which should not be processed. You may assume that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and  −10^4 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^4 for all i = 1 . . . n.</p>
