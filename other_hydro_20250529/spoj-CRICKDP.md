<p>Swagger loves playing cricket and its his childhood dream to represent his &nbsp;country at international level. A cricket tournament is being organised by BCCI to select few young talents in country. He played <strong>N</strong> matches and he was rated by selectors and public on basis of his performance in each match. Rating for his perormances are given below in <strong>1</strong> indexed array&nbsp;<strong>A</strong> where <strong>A<sub>i</sub></strong> is his rating in <strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong> match.</p>
<p>His performance in some of the matches were extraordinary but unfortunately, some were total failure. Now swagger has a chance to improve his total rating which is sum of ratings in each of the matches. As he knows some of&nbsp;<strong>M</strong> judges, he tried to bribe them &nbsp;and finally they agreed to remove the rating of few matches where they were incharge . The&nbsp;<strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong>&nbsp;judge demanded <strong>C<sub>i</sub></strong> amount of money for removing each match of swagger's choice in the range <strong>L<sub>i</sub></strong> to <strong>R<sub>i&nbsp;</sub></strong>(both inclusive). Ratings of removed match will not be used in calculating total rating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the real problem begins, &nbsp;he only has <strong>K</strong> amount of money and he wants to increase his total rating as high as possible . He is your friend and he also knows that you are a genious . Help him maximize his rating within the &nbsp;budget constraint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thats a simple task of you. Isn't it ?</p>
