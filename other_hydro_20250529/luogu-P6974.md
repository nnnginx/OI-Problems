## 题目描述
Garrison and Anderson are working in a company named “Adjustment Office”. In competing companies workers change the reality, in this company they try to predict the future.

They are given a big square board $n\times n$. Initially in each cell $(x, y)$ of this board the value of $x + y$ is written $(1\leq x, y\leq n$). They know that in the future there will be two types of queries on the board:
- “R $r$” ― sum up all values in row $r$, print the result and set all values in row $r$ to zero;
- “C $c$” ― sum up all values in column $c$, print the result and set all values in column $c$ to zero.

They have predicted what queries and results there will be. They need to ensure that they have correctly predicted the results. Help them by computing the results of the queries.


## 输入格式
The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ $(1\leq n\leq10^6$, $1\leq q\leq10^5$) ― the size of the square and the number of queries.

Each of the next $q$ lines contains the description of the query. Each query is either “R $r$” $(1\leq r\leq n$) or “C $c$” $(1\leq c\leq n$).

## 输出格式
The output file shall contain $q$ lines. The $i$ - th line shall contain one integer ― the result of the $i$ - th query. 

## 题目大意
有一个大小为 $n\times n$ 的矩阵，每个位置的值为该位置的行数+列数。

接下来有 $q$ 次操作：

- $R\ m$：输出第 $m$ 行的总和并整行消去。
- $C\ m$：输出第 $m$ 列的总和并整列消去。

$1\leqslant n\leqslant 10^6$，$1\leqslant q\leqslant 10^5$，$1\leqslant m\leqslant n$。
