<h3>Input</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each input contains several test cases. The ﬁrst line of every test case contains a</p>
<p>number N , which is the number of particules of that sample (2 ≤ N ≤ 100, 000).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After there are N lines to follow. Each of them contains 3 integers, li , xi , yi , which</p>
<p>are the actual layer, the position corresponding corresponding to the X-axis, and</p>
<p>the position corresponding to Y-axis (1 ≤ li , xi , yi ≤ 1, 000, 000, 000).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each output you print one integer, DIST AN CE, which corresponds to the value</p>
<p>of the farthest distance between particules in the that sample.</p>
