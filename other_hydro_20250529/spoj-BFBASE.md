<p>Basil and Blaise are very interested in manufacturing sodium hydroxide, ammonia, and other bases. They currently work out of an old basement but are itching to establish a new home base at the base of a tall mountain overlooking the bay. They¡¯re meeting with their real estate agent, Bane, to look for a building large enough to house their basic operations. Bane seems like a trustworthy fellow, based on his professional manner and charming smile, but he secretly harbors base intentions. He uses a special bank, Hexcorp, that conducts all of its business in hexadecimal. He is extra careful to make sure all the figures in his contracts use only the digits 0 through 9, even though they are in hexadecimal, in the hopes that his clients will unwittingly agree to his inflated prices so he can keep a hefty share for himself. He has included a notice about his unusual choice of numeric base in the very fine print of his contracts, to protect himself legally and cover all bases.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Basil and Blaise always read contracts very carefully before signing them, and the strange notice catches their attention. But they don¡¯t know anything about converting numbers between bases, since before turning to chemistry Basil was a professional baseball player and Blaise was an aspiring bass guitarist, and neither has had much mathematical training. Please help them avoid getting scammed by sending them a program that will allow them to take an integer in one base and convert it into another base. But be careful: Bane has a deep network of spies, and if they intercept your correspondence, Bane may take drastic action. Luckily, his spies don¡¯t understand brainf**k, so you can safely send them anything in that language.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can use any programming language you want, as long as it is brainf**k.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>For clarity, all integers in this section are given in decimal.</p>
<p>The first line contains an integer <strong>T</strong> (1 ¡Ü <strong>T</strong> ¡Ü 1000) expressed in decimal. Then follow <strong>T</strong> lines, each containing 3 space-separated integers: <strong>B1</strong> and <strong>B2</strong> (2 ¡Ü <strong>B1</strong>,<strong>B2</strong> ¡Ü 35) expressed in base <strong>36</strong>, followed by <strong>N</strong> (0 ¡Ü <strong>N</strong> ¡Ü 35^35) expressed in base <strong>B1</strong>. For bases greater than 10, only uppercase letters are used.</p>
<p>Each line, including the last, is terminated by a single newline (linefeed) character, which has ASCII value 10.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p><strong>T</strong> lines containing <strong>N</strong> expressed in base <strong>B2</strong>. For bases greater than 10, only uppercase letters are allowed.</p>

<h3>Additional Info</h3>
<p>There are two randomly generated data sets, one with <strong>T</strong>=1000 and the other with <strong>T</strong>=500. <strong>B1</strong> and <strong>B2</strong> are generated independently, and the average value of either is about 18.5. The average number of digits in <strong>N</strong> when expressed in decimal is about 14.</p>
