## 题目描述


Eva is a third-grade elementary school student. She has just learned how to perform addition and subtraction of arbitrary-precision integers. Her homework is to evaluate some expressions. It is boring, so she decided to add a little trick to the homework. Eva wants to add some plus and minus signs to the expression to make its value as large as possible.



## 输入格式


The single line of the input file contains the original arithmetic expression. It contains only digits, plus $(‘+')$ and minus $(‘-')$ signs.

The original expression is correct, that is:

numbers have no leading zeroes;

there are no two consecutive signs;

the last character of the expression is a digit.

The length of the original expression does not exceed $1000$ characters.



## 输出格式


Output a single line -- the original expression with some plus and minus signs added. Output expression must satisfy the same correctness constraints as the original one. Its value must be as large as possible.



## 题目大意

现向一个仅含有加减号和数字的表达式中添加一些加号或减号， 使得操作后的**合法**表达式的值最大， 并输出操作后的表达式。

当一个表达式合法时满足以下条件：

1.每一个数字**不含前导零**。

2.表达式里没有两个**连续的符号**。

3.表达式的最后一个字符是数字。

保证原始表达式是合法的， 且长度不大于 $1000$。




```input1
10+20-30

```

```output1
10+20-3+0

```

```input2
-3-4-1

```

```output2
-3-4-1

```

```input3
+10

```

```output3
+10

```
