<p>Dr. Charles Xavier is trying to check the correlation between the DNA samples of Magneto and Wolverine. Both the DNAs are of length <span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span>, and can be described by using all integers between <span style="font-weight: bold;">1</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span> exactly once. The correlation between two DNAs is defined as the Longest Common Subsequence of both the DNAs.<br> Help Dr. Xavier find the correlation between the two DNAs.</p>
<h3>Input :</h3>
<p>First line of input contains number of Test Cases <span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>.<br> ach test case starts with an integer <span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span>, size of DNA.<br> Next two lines contains <span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span> integers each, first line depicting the sequence of Magneto's DNA and second line depicting Wolverine's DNA.</p>
<h3>Output :</h3>
<p>For each test case print one integer, the correlation between the two DNAs.</p>
