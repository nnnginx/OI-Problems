<p>There're given 5 points in 3D coordinates (integers 0&lt;=x,y,z&lt;100). Their order is arbitrary. 4 of them are the vertices of a tetrahedron whose edges can be of different size. One&nbsp;is lying&nbsp;in this tetrahedron. Find its index (1-5)&nbsp;in the array of points.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>In the first line the number T (T&lt;1000) of test cases.<br>Then for each test case 5 lines with the space separated x-, y- and z-coordinates of the 5 points.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case a line with&nbsp;the index of that point which is lying in the tetrahedron formed of the 4 other points.</p>
