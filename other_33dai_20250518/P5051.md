## 题目描述
We need to arrange M kids in N teams. We begin by placing K kids in each team, starting
from the first to the $N^{th}$
team. When we finish with the $N^{th}$
team, we switch directions and
continue, placing K kids in each team, from the $(N-1)^{th}$
to the first team, respectively. When
we finish with the first team, we switch directions again and continue the process from the
second to the $N^{th}$
team, respectively, and so on until there are no kids left to distribute. For
example, if we have three teams, we will place K kids in teams in the following order: first
team, second team, third team, second team, first team, second team, etc.

If, at any points, there are less than K kids left to place in the current team, we place all the
remaining kids in that team and end the process.

Output the number of kids in each team when the process ends.

## 输入格式
The first line of input contains the integers N (2 ≤ N ≤ 200 000), K and M
(1 ≤ K ≤ M ≤ 2 000 000 000) from the task.

## 输出格式
In a single line, output the number of kids in each of the N teams, respectively from the first
to the $N^{th}$
team.

## 题目大意
把$m$个人放在$n$个队伍里。
规则：
- 每次放$k$个人
- 顺序为$1^{th}$->$2^{th}$->$3^{th}$->……->$(n-1)^{th}$->$n^{th}$->$(n-1)^{th}$->$(n-2)^{th}$->……->$2^{th}$->$1^{th}$->$2^{th}$->……
- 一直重复到$\text{当前剩余人数}<k$为止。此时剩下的人全部放在当前队里
### **输入格式：** 一行，分别是$\text{n、k、m}$
### **输出格式：** 一行，$n$个数，分别是每个队伍分到的人数

```input1
2 1 3
```

```output1

5 1 0 0
```

## 提示
In test cases worth a total of 40 points, it will hold M / K ≤ 200 000.
