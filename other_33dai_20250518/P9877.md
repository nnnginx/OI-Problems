## 题目描述
Prof. Pang has an annual leave of $c$ days and he wants to go on vacation.

Now there are $n$ days in a year. Prof. Pang can gain $a_i$ happiness if he rests on the $i$-th day. The values of happiness, $a_i$, may be negative.

Prof. Pang wants you to do $m$ operations:

- $1~x~y$, change the happiness of the $x$-th day to $y$.
- $2~l~r$, Prof. Pang wants to find a period of vacation in $[l, r]$. He wants to rest for several (possibly $0$) days in a row and gain as much happiness as possible. However, he only has $c$ days off, thus he can rest for no more than $c$ consecutive days in $[l,r]$.

That means he wants to find 

$$\max\left(\max_{l \leq l' \leq r' \leq r\atop r'-l'+1\leq c}  ~~ \left(\sum_{i=l'} ^{r'} a_i\right), 0\right).$$


## 输入格式
The first line contains three integers $n, m, c (1\leq n\leq 2\times 10^5, 1\leq m \leq 5\times 10^5, 1\leq c\leq n)$ indicating the number of days in a year, the number of operations, and Prof. Pang's annual leave days.

The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n(-10^9 \leq a_i\leq 10^9)$ indicating the values of happiness of every day.

The next $m$ lines are the $m$ operations in the format described above.

It is guaranteed that $1\leq x\leq n, -10^9\leq y\leq 10^9, 1\leq l\leq r \leq n$.

## 输出格式
For each operation of the second type, print the answer.
