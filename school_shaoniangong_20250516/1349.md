描述

A single-player game is played on a rectangular board divided in R rows and C columns. There is a single uppercase letter (A-Z) written in every position in the board.
Before the begging of the game there is a figure in the upper-left corner of the board (first row, first column). In every move, a player can move the figure to the one of the adjacent positions (up, down,left or right). Only constraint is that a figure cannot visit a position marked with the same letter twice.
The goal of the game is to play as many moves as possible.
Write a program that will calculate the maximal number of positions in the board the figure can visit in a single game.

翻译：
给出一个$\red{R * S}$的大写字母矩阵，一开始的位置为左上角，你可以向上下左右四个方向移动，并且不能移向曾经经过的字母。问最多可以经过几个字母。

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two integers R and S, separated by a single blank character, 1 <= R, S <= 20.

The following R lines contain S characters each. Each line represents one row in the board.

## 输出格式

The first and only line of the output should contain the maximal number of position in the board the figure can visit.
