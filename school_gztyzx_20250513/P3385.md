<h2>Description</h2>
Given a prime $P$&#44; $2 \leq P &lt; 2^{31}$&#44; an integer $B$&#44; $2 \leq B &lt; P$&#44; and an integer $N$&#44; $1 \leq N &lt; P$&#44; compute the discrete logarithm of $N$&#44; ba<x>se $B$&#44; modulo $P$. That is&#44; find an integer $L$ such that $B^L \equiv N (mod\ P)$<br />

<h2>Input Format</h2>
Read several lines of input&#44; each containing $P&#44;B&#44;N$ separated by a space.
<h2>Output Format</h2>
For each line print the logarithm on a separate line. If there are several&#44; print the smallest; if there is none&#44; print "no solution".

<h2>Hint</h2>
The solution to this problem requires a well known result in number theory that is probably expected of you for Putnam but not ACM competitions. It is Fermat's theorem that states<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; $B^{(P-1)} \equiv 1 (mod\ P)$<br />
<br />
for any prime $P$ and some other (fairly rare) numbers known as ba<x>se-B pseudoprimes. A rarer subset of the ba<x>se-B pseudoprimes&#44; known as Carmichael numbers&#44; are pseudoprimes for every ba<x>se between 2 and P-1. A corollary to Fermat's theorem is that for any m<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; $B^{(-m)} \equiv B^{(P-1-m)} (mod\ P)$ .<br />
