Special for beginners, ^_^

# Description

**Given two integers x and y, print the sum.![](https://darkbzoj.cc/problem/images/1954.jpg)

给定一棵n个点的带权树，求树上最长的异或和路径**

# Format

## Input

The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n(1<=n<=100000), The following n-1 lines each contains three integers u(0 <= u < n),v(0 <= v < n),w(0 <= w < 2^31), which means there is an edge between node u and v of length w.

## Output

For each test case output the xor-length of the xor-longest path.

# Samples

```input1
4
1 2 3
2 3 4
2 4 6
```

```output1
7
```

# Limitation

The xor-longest path is 1->2->3, which has length 7 (=3  4)
注意：结点下标从1开始到N....
