# Background

Special for beginners, ^_^

# Description

There is a random sequence L whose element are all random numbers either -1 or 1 with the same possibility. Now we define MAVS, the abbreviate of Maximum Absolute Value Subsequence, to be any (if more than one) subsequences of L whose absolute value is maximum among all subsequences. Given the length of L, your task is to find the expectation of the absolute value of MAVS.

# Format

## Input

There is only one input file. The first line is the number of test cases T. T positive integers follow, each of which contains one positive number not greater than 1500 denoted the length of L.

给你一个数字L,代表数字串长。这个数字串每个元素为1或-1.

那么就有这个数列有2^L种可能。

现对每个可能的数字串，求其连续子串和，并将和取绝对值，记下最大的那个值。

再求出所有这些值的总和。

输入总和/2^L

## Output

For each test case, output the expectation you are required to calculate. Answers are rounded to 6 numbers after the decimal point.(as shown in the sample output)

# Samples

```input1
Case 1: 1.000000
Case 2: 2.750000
Case 3: 4.167969
```

```output1
623
```

# Limitation

当输入2时，有

1 1

1 -1

-1 1

-1 -1

这四种可能，其对应的值分别为(2+1+1+2)=6

6/4=1.5
