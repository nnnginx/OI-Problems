# Description

Consider *n* distinct points on a plane.

Two points from that set are said to be  *friends* , when there exists a rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes that contains those two points and doesn't contain any other point from the given set. A rectangle is said to *contain* a point if the point lies within the rectangle or on its border.

How many pairs of friends are there among the given points?

求这样的点对个数：以两点连线为对角线的矩形内不存在其他点（也不能在边界上）

# Format

## Input

The first line of the input file contains an integer  *n* ,1<=N<=100 000.

The next *n* lines contain two integers each, the coordinates of the given points. The coordinates don't exceed 10^9^ by absolute value.

## Output

Output one integer number ― the sought number of pairs of friends.
