# Background

Special for beginners, ^_^

# Description

Given the Cartesian coordinates of n (> 0) 2-dimensional points, write a program that computes the area of their smallest bounding rectangle (smallest rectangle containing all the given points).

# Format

## Input

The input file may contain multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a positive integer n (< 1001) indicating the number of points in this test case. Then follows n lines each containing two real numbers giving respectively the x- and y-coordinates of a point. The input terminates with a test case containing a value 0 for n which must not be processed.

## Output

For each test case in the input print a line containing the area of the smallest bounding rectangle rounded to the 4th digit after the decimal point.
