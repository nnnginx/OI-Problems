# Description

Farmer John has been informed of the location of a fugitive cow and wants to catch her immediately. He starts at a point N (0 <= N <= 100,000) on a number line and the cow is at a point K (0 <= K <= 100,000) on the same number line. Farmer John has two modes of transportation: walking and teleporting. * Walking: FJ can move from any point X to the points X-1 or X+1 in a single minute * Teleporting: FJ can move from any point X to the point 2*X in a single minute. If the cow, unaware of its pursuit, does not move at all, how long does it take for Farmer John to retrieve it?

农夫约翰被通知，他的一只奶牛逃逸了！所以他决定，马上幽发，尽快把那只奶牛抓回来．

他们都站在数轴上．约翰在N(O≤N≤100000)处，奶牛在K(O≤K≤100000)处．约翰有
```

两种办法移动，步行和瞬移：步行每秒种可以让约翰从z处走到x+l或x-l处；而瞬移则可让他在1秒内从x处消失，在2x处出现．然而那只逃逸的奶牛，悲剧地没有发现自己的处境多么糟糕，正站在那儿一动不动．

```
那么，约翰需要多少时间抓住那只牛呢？
