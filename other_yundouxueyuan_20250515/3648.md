# Background

Special for beginners, ^_^

# Description

有一行 N 个弹子，每一个都有一个颜色。每次可以让超过 K 个的连续的同颜色的一段 弹子消失，剩下的会重新紧凑在一起。你有无限的所有颜色的弹子，要求在这行弹子中插入 最少的弹子，使得弹子全部消失。

# Format

## Input

The first line of input contains two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and K (2 ≤ K ≤ 5) - the number of marbles in the initial sequence and the minimal number of consecutive marbles of the same color he could wish to vanish. The next line contains exactly N integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), separated by one space. Those numbers represent colors of marbles in the sequence Mirko found.

## Output

The output should contain only one line with a single integer number - the minimal number of marbles Mirko has to insert to achive the desired effect.
