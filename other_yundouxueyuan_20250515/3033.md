# Description

The cows are building a roller coaster! They want your help to design as fun a roller coaster as possible, while keeping to the budget. The roller coaster will be built on a long linear stretch of land of length L (1 <= L <= 1,000). The roller coaster comprises a collection of some of the N (1 <= N <= 10,000) different interchangable components. Each component i has a fixed length Wi (1 <= Wi <= L). Due to varying terrain, each component i can be only built starting at location Xi (0 <= Xi <= L-Wi). The cows want to string together various roller coaster components starting at 0 and ending at L so that the end of each component (except the last) is the start of the next component. Each component i has a "fun rating" Fi (1 <= Fi <= 1,000,000) and a cost Ci (1 <= Ci <= 1000). The total fun of the roller coster is the sum of the fun from each component used; the total cost is likewise the sum of the costs of each component used. The cows' total budget is B (1 <= B <= 1000). Help the cows determine the most fun roller coaster that they can build with their budget.

奶牛们正打算造一条过山车轨道．她们希望你帮忙，找出最有趣，但又符合预算的方案．  过山车的轨道由若干钢轨首尾相连，由x=0处一直延伸到X=L(1≤L≤1000)处．现有N(1≤N≤10000)根钢轨，每根钢轨的起点Xi(0≤Xi≤L- Wi)，长度wi(l≤Wi≤L)，有趣指数Fi(1≤Fi≤1000000)，成本Ci(l≤Ci≤1000)均己知．请确定一种最优方案，使得选用的钢轨的有趣指数之和最大，同时成本之和不超过B(1≤B≤1000)．

# Format

## Input

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: L, N and B.
* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains four space-separated integers, respectively: Xi, Wi, Fi, and Ci.
  
  第1行输入L，N，B，接下来N行，每行四个整数Xi，wi，Fi，Ci．

## Output

* Line 1: A single integer that is the maximum fun value that a roller-coaster can have while staying within the budget and meeting all the other constraints. If it is not possible to build a roller-coaster within budget, output -1.
