# Description

You travel through a scenic landscape consisting mostly of mountains - there are n landmarks(peaks a

nd valleys) on your path. You pause for breath and wonder: which mountain are voucurrently seeing on

the horizon?Formally: you are given a polygonal chain PIP2 - Pn in the plane. The x coordinates of

thepoints are in strictly increasing order. For each segment PiPi+l of this chain, find the smallest

index j > i, for which any point of PjPj+i is visible from PiPi+l (lies strictly above the ravPiPi~+

l ) .

给定一个折线图，按x轴递增的顺序给出。对于每个条line，求出在它之后，且下标最小的line。输出这个下标。

n<=100000

# Format

## Input

The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. The descriptions of the test cases

follow:

The first line of each test case contains an integer 'n (2< = N < 100000) - the number ofvertices on

the chain.Each of the following n lines contains integer coordinates xi, Yi of the vertex Pi (0 < xi

<X2 < ... < Xn≤ 109; 0 < Yi < 10^9).

## Output

For each test case, output a single line contaimng n - I space-separated integers. These shouldbe th

e smallest indices of chain segments visible to the right, or o when no such segment exists.Problem

B: Mountainous landscape
